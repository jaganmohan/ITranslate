NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's "zone."

The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions

Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity
We already know this
Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?

Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community
But that attitude is undermining change
At the same time, the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications – one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen, prior to a meeting, draped in a Palestinian flag – and unwitting condescension
