SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold
And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s
Precedents exist for this
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO's central command
These precedents can be extended
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe. That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump
A big new push for growth is therefore vital
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks; now it needs to support the real economy, too
Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan?
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging, but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical, cultural, religious, and political identities of Iraqi individuals
In this capacity, Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions, for it signifies centuries-old co-existence and adjustment
Is this realistic?
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time, they will together account for a mere 6% of its total GDP
1929 or 1989?
For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989
In better shape, but not alone
On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated
They can destroy but not create
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient
A “Portfolio” Approach to Climate Change
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty, due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009
Georgia’s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment, for which there is hardly any appetite today
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis
Political association with the EU, and the process of integration under this Partnership, will promote reforms in these key areas
But the containment argument fails, because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner
This has been said many times, but repetition does not diminish its importance
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way
NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's "zone."
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast
That, too, would not have been unusual
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates
One might argue that itwas
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop
A Bomb in Every Reactor
BERLIN – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity
We already know this
Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige
Iran is the most current example of this
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?
Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community
But that attitude is undermining change
At the same time, the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications – one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen, prior to a meeting, draped in a Palestinian flag – and unwitting condescension
The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions, that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation, or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence, is, in this framework, never admitted
Many of the boycotts’ critics are also critical of Israel
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness
On the contrary, everything becomes brighter
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics
India’s Change of Guard
On one level, this was a routine announcement that many had anticipated – after all, Rajan is arguably the best-known Indian economist of his generation
And India will be better for it
For a long time, Indian literature, especially in English, was dominated by a clique who wrote mainly for a niche audience and literary recognition
This claim was hugely misguided
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant

A Clockwork Chemistry
It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly
A Communist Party without Communism
So they panic
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction
It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies
That would be a disastrous step
Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro
NEW YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory?
I learned this by accident
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information, pitch stories, and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters
Indeed, when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office, you can be certain that he is up to no good
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election (or any other kind of election) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule
NEW YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession: it is mainly Europe and the United States, not the major emerging markets, that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment
It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro’s very survival was in growing jeopardy
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century
Obama inherited a terrible legacy – recession, financial meltdown, Iraq, Afghanistan
When I was growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union
The main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move, all of us might end up consumed in the flames of a nuclear holocaust
We have forgotten those days
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one
Other states, which have their own civil nuclear capacity, have the potential to develop a weapon
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it
A Crisis in Full Flight
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all
In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous
The market will prove one side right before too long
It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average
Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same
A Cure for Fiscal Failure?
There is a no easy way out
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia
It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward
SEOUL – It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country’s next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country’s leadership
And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status
Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron
She has been called the “Queen of Elections,” in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man
Park’s success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines
If she does, she will be Asia’s most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger
A Day of Liberation
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day, 6 June 1944
A war of memories, in turn, may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future
Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “politics of memory” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be
Fortunately, their propaganda campaign has been a failure
However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget
All this is perfectly true
A De-Globalized World?
Not necesarily
The first two models are at greater risk than the third
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services
There is in fact no inherent conflict, once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses, nor even the volume of their exports
It wasn’t Switzerland, but, by anyone’s measure, it was a genuine democracy
Chávez also repeats,ad nauseam, the idea that others are to blame for Latin America’s ills
In all of these areas, Venezuela is faring poorly even by Latin America’s low standards. This is particularly true in the case of institutional weakness
None of these ideas would fly, of course, in a contented nation
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort no current EU member could have contemplated
Suppose, for example, that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo
But a euro exit would be a messy affair
A VAT/payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing
Moreover, since exports are exempt from VAT, the price of domestic exports will fall
This policy can also help on the fiscal front
A Doomsday Scenario
To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day
A Dutch Treat for Brazil?
But nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms
Large fiscal deficits crowded out private investment
The defining moment came with the Wassenaar agreement of that year--a pact between employers and trade unions, reached with the active encouragement of government
A Europe for All
A Europe of Judges
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EU-level democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU’s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is consistent with the Basic Law
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM
To be viable, a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic

And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one’s fortune back home
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership. But they are reacting to the current situation
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal
Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq
But there are two things different about today
In a world in which the S&amp;P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year
It won’t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe, but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price
But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills, and return to help others here
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
For German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warring concepts, as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future

What, if anything, can Latin America expect from Pope Francis I?
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth
Are we preparing for a war against each other?” Biden, while reaffirming that the US does not view China as an enemy, implied that Fu’s worries are not fanciful, saying that the worst scenario is a misunderstanding that leads to an unintended conflict
Rather, it is how China intends to use its newly acquired economic and military strength in pursuing its domestic and foreign-policy goals – and how the world’s leading powers can ensure that they do not end up harming each other by accident or misunderstanding
China’s rise is a fact; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and, most importantly, the US
“This is a nightmare, which will pass away with the morning
An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom's drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings

SOEs undoubtedly played an important role in China’s previous growth model, delivering the infrastructure and services that were deemed necessary for the global manufacturing supply chain to function
Unless China’s leaders implement major structural reforms aimed at establishing a market-based growth model, they will be unable to avoid the “middle-income trap” that has prevented so many developing economies from attaining advanced-country status
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically

The model is simple: Countries assess their own situation, using tools that they develop and that are appropriate to the context, in order to formulate a vision and a plan to consolidate peace and achieve prosperity
Progress on meeting national priorities such as peace consolidation, expanding access to justice, or increasing security is monitored locally
The idea is basic and well known
Of course, some laboratories receive EU grants, but without recognizing a specific European mission in research policies
Of course, we must limit the scope of competition: there is no reason, for example, to extend it to taxation
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers (including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism), Abdullah believes, can restore some stability to the Middle East
But that is how it is in the Middle East: you never know what lies around the corner
As a result, both issues may well have to be addressed successfully prior to any move to lift the sanctions
Iran has tried two political approaches in the last ten years: a reformist model, under President Mohamed Khatami, and hardline radicalism, under Ahmadinejad
Despite these perceptions – or perhaps precisely because of them – Rowhani’s presidency offers an unexpected opportunity for both the nuclear negotiations and a political solution in Syria

Once they developed the basic institutions needed for a market economy and learned how to avoid serious macroeconomic policy mistakes, emerging countries started benefiting from catch-up growth
Nevertheless, the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance
In the eyes of many, that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War

He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements
At the same time, Saudi public opinion has been inflamed, mostly because of their rulers’ apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people, particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden’s lethal propaganda.  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians, but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America

To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible (though not legally probative), reputational damage to an attacker’s soft power may contribute to deterrence
Of course, non-state actors are harder to deter, so improved defenses such as pre-emption and human intelligence become important in such cases
Recent IMF experience suggests that, through appropriate coordination, private funds could be mobilized for big private-public partnership projects linking demand expansion with infrastructure investment
Until both are addressed properly, the West will remain burdened by sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and excessive income and wealth inequality

In the long run, Afghanistan has resources that can be exploited
To guarantee that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb, the US would need to maintain military pressure on Iran for several years
An attack on Iran, especially if it develops into a longer war involving regional proxies, is bound to become the trigger for mass anti-Israel and anti-US hysteria, which might draw the Islamist regimes in the region into a dynamic of escalation
The saddest part of the story is Israel’s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program
The expenses and pressure of the dowry system, and the fact that, in most joint families, only sons inherit property and wealth, contribute to this favoritism
But, unlike its neighbors, this year can mark a turning point for Burundi
About 600,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees

Moreover, he excelled at selling to audiences worldwide both his vision and his strategy for realizing it
The town of Port-de-Paix, slotted ten years ago by the IDB as the first project site due to its particularly deplorable water situation, has yet to see the implementation of any water projects

After an “age” of excessive leverage, debt creation, and credit entitlement that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, America still faces the tricky challenge of allocating cumulative losses that continuously inhibit investment, jobs, and competitiveness
It is much more about the accompanying concepts of social fairness, entitlement, equality and, yes, standards of behavior for a rich and civilized society
The sooner the campaign debate pivots to this, the greater the probability that Americans will make a more informed choice and, thus, buy into the collective effort needed to escape national malaise

For example, Obama’s appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state’s anti-union “right to work” legislation
Let’s be clear: elevated savings and reduced consumption relative to pre-crisis levels are likely to be permanent even after households reduce leverage and restore retirement savings – a process that in the US has removed roughly $1 trillion from the demand side of the economy
Recent studies by the International Monetary Fund indicate that in most advanced countries, including the US, the growth in budget deficits was largely automatic, owing far more to declining tax revenues and rising expenditures on unemployment benefits than to stimulus spending
At this stage, the best course would be to adopt a credible multi-year plan, based on reasonable but conservative growth assumptions, to reduce deficits to sustainable levels and limit the accumulation of public debt
The truth is that all the net employment growth in the US economy over the last 20 years has been in the non-tradable sector, where Americans don’t have to compete

The gargantuan US trade deficit?
The minutes of the January 29-30 meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) speak to a simmering discontent: “[M]any participants…expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases.”
But the aftershocks linger: Household-debt loads were still at 113% of disposable personal income in 2012 (versus 75% in the final three decades of the twentieth century), and the personal-saving rate averaged just 3.9% last year (compared to 7.9% from 1970 to 1999)
Expanded individual retirement accounts and 401K pension schemes, special incentives for low-income households (most of which have no retirement plans), and an end to the financial repression that the Fed’s zero-interest-rate policy imposes on savers must also be part of the solution
This level of annual borrowing is far too high for comfort
After all, the rich are living better than ever, while the rest of American society is suffering
Everything now is about money to run electoral campaigns, which have become incredibly expensive
But, after 1985, a variety of changes caused saving to decline until it reached less than 2% in 2007

In 1973 the poorest fifth of America's families had incomes that averaged $13,240 a year (in today's dollars); in 2000 the average incomes of the poorest fifth were the same: $13,320
These realities represent a power shift of a kind that we have not experienced in our lifetimes
Why didn’t the American press corps cover the Bush administration properly for its first five years?
The old system worked well for the bankers (if not for their shareholders), so why should they embrace change?
Reversing this trend is not only in America’s interest, but also in the world’s interest
That is why Obama called for an increase in US public investment in three areas: education, science and technology, and infrastructure (including broadband Internet, fast rail, and clean energy)
On the other hand, US taxes are chronically too low to support the level of government investment that is needed
To do so would require calling for higher taxes, and that – as George H. W. Bush learned in 1992 – is no way to get re-elected
The Asia-Pacific region will loom larger in Obama’s second-term agenda, especially as the ongoing US troop withdrawal ends the Afghanistan war by 2014
First, it has contributed to rising oil prices
Then there’s the policy of using them as logistical hubs in the Afghanistan war
Ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the US military has gained an outsize voice in the formulation of US foreign policy
And countries like Turkey and Brazil (and perhaps India and Egypt) could play a useful role by devising face-saving ways for the Iranians to meet the international community’s demands, together with longer-term alternatives for fuel enrichment that would be consistent with reducing the global nuclear threat
On another occasion the room was unventilated, the temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him – “he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night.”
The Cold War ended a generation ago; the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are nearly a decade in the past
Similarly, Europeans are rich enough to manage their own security
Even in the era of alleged American hegemony, studies show that only one-fifth of America’s efforts to compel change in other countries through military threats were successful, while economic sanctions worked in only half of all cases
But today I regard it as equally important to challenge the new conventional wisdom that America is invincible, and that the "new unilateralism" should guide US foreign policy
The world has moved from the Cold War to the Global Information Age, but the dominant foreign policy paradigms have not kept pace
Although American commitments to Lebanon, Somalia, Vietnam, and Cambodia differed mightily, history reveals that despite immediate costs to America’s reputation, disengagement ultimately redounded to America’s advantage. 
The US humanitarian mission to that benighted country sought to salvage a failed United Nations enterprise to secure and feed Somalia’s ravaged population
As unrest mounted with these military retreats, offshore US forces monitored and intercepted jihadists who sought to enter Somalia, while Kenya and Ethiopia blocked the unrest from metastasizing across the region
NEW YORK – When America absorbed the bombings at the Boston Marathon, what was striking was what did not happen
Their self-image is no longer that of the “good guys,” against whom an act of violence is mad and inexplicable
Danny claimed that the only word of the brothers’ conversation that he understood was “Manhattan,” and that the terrorists had asked him if his car could leave the state – say, to get to New York
But condemning thousands to death in order to be able to punish him is intolerable as well
But, because productivity ultimately must be built on innovation, not just on ever more buildings and equipment, it was inevitable that returns on investment would turn south at some point
Again, a great deal of attention has been lavished on the ebbs and flow of fiscal and monetary policy
For better or for worse, productivity trends are very difficult to extrapolate, depending as they do on hugely complex interactions of social, economic, and political forces
The current crop of left-wing political leaders is different from the populist “caudillos” of the past
To the Spaniards, it helps to justify their abrupt withdrawal from Iraq in 2004; for the Turks, it is yet another vehicle in their struggle, as the vital bridge between Islam and the West, for admission into the European Union
But it suffers from the major global players’ profound skepticism, with the US, Russia, and, for that matter, the EU shown no real enthusiasm for it
But a gradual phase-in of an overall cap on tax deductions and exclusions (so-called tax expenditures), combined with reform of entitlement spending, could achieve the long-run fiscal consolidation that America needs without risking a new recession
Such an overall cap would allow each taxpayer to retain all of his existing deductions and exclusions but would limit the amount by which he could reduce his tax liability in this way
Argentina's financial panic and the run on its banks that ensued, as well as Asia's financial crisis of 1997, have forced a number of countries to consider adopting deposit insurance schemes to protect their citizens' savings
This is highly inefficient, because while it isindividually rational for depositors to want their money immediately, the bank might have been able to service all of them had they beencollectively patient
How would it be run?
Russia considers the agreements from the 1990’s unjust, based as they were on its weakness at the time, and it wants to revise them

The rise of China is a major factor in the politics of the twenty-first century
But this assumes that our income relative to the income of others does not matter
Looser US monetary policy has thus set the tempo for inflation in a significant chunk – perhaps as much as 60% – of the global economy
Under Obama, the US has begun to depart from this approach
But, while this was reflected in reformist trends in the country’s wider political life, a movement toward militant fundamentalism took shape within the regime’s power structure

CAMBRIDGE – As Europe struggles to save the euro, the chorus of complaints about weak leadership in the world’s major economies grows louder
Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a major regional – and indeed global – power, an ambition that can only grow stronger as it watches Turkey’s geopolitical stature rise
The ultimate winner in the interim agreement with Iran is the cause of diplomacy itself
In an uncertain age, whoever defines us first, whether a politician, an artist, or an intellectual, will merit a prominent place in our history
That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province’s fate is looming

On the contrary, they need to stand together against the Communist threat
Why, then, do many countries prosecute the hate speech of racists?

His son’s ascension, unlike that of Bashar on the eve of his father’s death, is anything but settled
No one predicted what happened in Egypt and Tunisia, which means that no Arab country is immune

Nordbanken had become fully state-owned and a new management was put in place to restore the bank to viability
The radical solution was to separate all the assets that were alien to the bank’s core business, mainly real estate companies, but also firms in the manufacturing, construction, and service industries
·        Government subsidies for private bad banks, or public bad banks to clean up private banks’ toxic assets, are a bad way for taxpayers to transfer money to troubled banks compared to normal capital injections

In the 1970’s and 1980’s, West German authorities allowed psychologists and psychiatrists to interview terrorism suspects then being held in prison or awaiting trial, including members of the Red Army Faction
It must be admitted, of course, that our access to real-life terrorists is limited, and we still have much to learn about the kind of environments that foster terroristic behavior
But their sharp distinction between the country’s economic interests and the interests of US multinational companies is misleading
The international monetary system is likely to cease being dominated by a single currency over the same years
The scary story that is being amplified now concerns the developing world, notably China and India, where rapid economic growth - and no restrictions on emissions under the Kyoto Protocol - are seen as creating insatiable demands for oil
Indeed, the International Energy Agency noted in September that the usual relationship between oil prices and inventory levels has broken down, with prices much higher than the usual relationship would suggest
But this raises some important questions: are humans continuing to evolve –&#160;and, if so, is our basic biological nature changing – or has modern culture stopped evolution?

Indeed, the sum Argentina spends on its diplomats is what tiny Ireland spends on its Export Promotion Agency, an institution Argentina never bothered to create
So it is surprising that this choice is not at the center of the political debate in the campaign for the presidency now underway
Since Argentina has been in crisis so often, investors always fear the worst and withdraw funds at the first hint of trouble, provoking an even deeper crisis
An economy’s technological capacity depends on a wide range of social institutions. A well-functioning market system helps attract high-tech investors from abroad and fosters high-technology startups at home
The reform prescriptions it followed helped end inflation but ignored the need for government to promote a knowledge-based economy
Fear of these costs, combined with IMF bailouts, kept Argentina from abandoning its currency board long after it was clear that the system could not be sustained
Centering attention on reactivation makes clear why the focus on IMF credits is misguided

The Fed, its critics complain, has used its expansive powers to engage in a range of unprecedented interventions that have propped up large financial institutions
An audit would also reveal more details about financial-market interventions like those in 2008, when the Fed purchased mortgage securities from Bear Stearns and AIG
In 1932, the Fed was unwilling to help stabilize a collapsing banking system
Osborne argued that Britain was on the brink: that there was no alternative to his policy if the country was to avoid a massive crisis of confidence
The judges then denied our request for a postponement of the court decision until Mr. Winata's perjury case was resolved
But President Suharto's regime began another press crackdown in the early 1970's, ultimately banning various media and jailing many journalists
But Tymoshenko’s party successfully submitted its list in the very same format at the March 2006 election, which demonstrates the glaringly partisan nature of the election commission’s ruling
The days of empire are over, no matter how much wealth oil and gas is bringing to Russia
Then, as now, many people demanded some punishment for the banks and bankers
At a time of economic and institutional crisis in Europe, all European leaders appear to be, well, extremely normal
It was a necessary, if infuriating, act of salvation to avoid economic disaster
The problems in the US economy and financial system have been apparent for years
That means no meals out for a while, no new cars, and no new clothes
Balanced-budget stimulus was first advocated in the early 1940’s by William Salant, an economist in President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration, and by Paul Samuelson, then a young economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Some form of debt-friendly stimulus might ultimately appeal to voters if they could be convinced that raising taxes does not necessarily mean hardship or increased centralization of decision-making
For instance, if I save $100, but at the same time I invest $100 in my factories’ fixed assets, I am “balanced domestically” and not running an export surplus with anyone
Rather, savings should be channeled even more – and more efficiently – to domestic investment in order to avoid large external imbalances
Moreover, investment in public infrastructure and urban facilities will not create industrial “over-capacity”; instead, it will provide long-term public consumption durables that households and companies will use for years to come
In that capacity, I see the Secretary-General in action in all parts of the world
Ban has tirelessly emphasized the need to put sustainable development at the center of our thinking
He has championed the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, bringing many global leaders and public figures to the cause
Ban, who has just marked the half-way point in his five-year term in office, has so far been unable to attract a large worldwide audience for his activities.  This is due, in part, to stylistic reasons, but also to the vagaries of UN diplomacy
FRANKFURT – With the deepening of the global financial crisis, spreads between the government bonds of different European Monetary Union (EMU) countries for a while widened dramatically
But today, countries with rising budget deficits, like Ireland, along with countries with high levels of public debt, like Greece and Italy, are at risk to pay substantially higher rates on their government bonds
With more and more subsistence farmers being driven off their land by pressures far beyond their control, we need to find better ways to balance the needs and rights of rural and urban populations
There may be two explanations for this: for one thing, Asia’s share in European banks’ revenues has probably risen
In that case, banking will become more like other industries that have benefited themselves and their customers by evolving into truly global networks
For China now has a bankruptcy code with teeth, and the country’s courts are beginning to enforce it with rigor
Traditional mid-sized European states cannot afford to have a strategic vision for their banks
In 2001, a non-state group killed more Americans than the government of Japan killed at Pearl Harbor
For example, international financial stability is vital to American prosperity, but the US needs the cooperation of others to ensure it
With its rise to global supremacy, America had become the incarnation of the West, and the West was seen as “white.”
In the end, we might end up with four more years of American resistance to binding international mechanisms
In France the government is composed of mainstream center-right politicians
Even non-economically-minded voters perceive the striking difference with the US, where productivity growth has skyrocketed since the mid-1990s and unemployment is far lower
The opposition posed by this newly empowered political constituency could be decisive
If, for example, a target country provides minimum wage guarantees and replacement incomes for the domestic unemployed, immigrants simply force domestic residents into the care of the welfare state
In the more unsuccessful countries – Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands – the proportion of immigrants with a tertiary education is below a quarter
History will have many tales to tell about what this really meant for the Continent
After all, steel companies have an inherent need to hedge against fluctuations in the price of iron ore, just as airlines and utilities have an inherent need to hedge against fluctuations in the price of oil
The job of Commission President is arguably among the most difficult in the world
For reasons that are now obscure, there is an unwritten rule that Commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers
If he is to reassure EU national leaders that they should re-appoint him, then he needs to signal that his second term can hold out fresh promise
It remains to be seen whether it can effectively restore some monetary-policy influence
In that case, the generalized silence could indicate that all other central banks entertain the possibility of using that option, which would be most worrisome
In recent weeks, Japan became the first large industrial economy to intervene directly in currency markets
But industrial countries, too, intervene substantially in markets
Rather than intervening to obtain a short-term increase in their share of slow-growing global demand, it makes sense for countries to make their economies more balanced and efficient over the medium term
Blinded with grief and rage, the US would exact a terrible revenge
After the Great Depression of the 1930’s, the vast wave of investment in industrial capacity during World War II made up the shortfall of the lost decade
Furthermore, contrary to claims that securing Kismayo put al-Shabaab at a disadvantage, the United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea reported in July that the Kenyan Defense Forces have actually gone into business with al-Shabaab
Neither agreement lasted long
Italy has a few large corporations, mainly in services, utilities, or sectors shielded from competition
As a result, Italy is receiving immigrants with relatively low skills, while many of its most productive young graduates emigrate to the US, the UK, or other European countries
Why has the government achieved so little, despite a large majority in Parliament, widespread backing among the population, and supportive media?
As Berlusconi bluntly put it, closer relations with Libya are about “fewer illegal immigrants and more oil.”
Italy’s conflict of interest could damage more than the trust of its allies
For Bersani, creating a coalition with Monti may well be the key to gaining control of the upper house and, in turn, of the government
Given the sluggish recovery, Bernanke could have gone even further and argued that the Fed is the one who has it right
He has already guided the Fed through two very tumultuous years with only one major mistake – the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
But as health expenses start taking up a third of national income, healthcare socialism starts becoming just plain Marxism: to each according to his needs
But today, the balance is shifting. Heart operations are already a major factor in extending life in many rich countries
Throughout the crisis, as business confidence evaporated, banks were forced to sell assets and cut lending in order to maintain capital requirements stipulated by the Accords
These debentures should be designed to create a strong incentive for bank managers and shareholders to issue equity rather than suffer conversion
These three measures, if applied to all banks, would eliminate the need for special rules governing liquidity or funding (which would remain open to supervisory review, but not to binding constraints)
This enormous subsidy to American taxpayers is, in many ways, the world’s largest foreign aid program
But it would be more accurate to say that there is global investment shortfall, with investment trending downwards despite the upward trend in global growth
But some day, the US may well have to pay the bill for its spendthrift ways
The pressure on African governments to enact legislation against terrorism may pose new threats to civil liberties at the very moment when democratization is gathering momentum
In these countries, too, screening mechanisms have been strengthened, and China and Russia, as well as some other emerging markets, are following suit
Moreover, it is hard to see how anyone – even the IMF, as the US proposal envisions – could enforce caps on trade surpluses
Germany might rightly argue that it has followed a relatively laissez-faire attitude towards trade, and that it should not be punished, despite its chronic surpluses
These elements of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy can reduce the threat to manageable, or at least tolerable, levels
More must be done to interrupt the recruitment of terrorists, thereby reducing the threat before it materializes
This is not nearly as desirable an outcome as Pakistan joining what should be a common international effort
At Fukushima, the reactors withstood a magnitude 9.0 earthquake – far more powerful than they were designed to tolerate
Continuing to invest in global health makes sense both in terms of lives and dollars saved
Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, as well as Georgia’s Rose Revolution, seems to confirm this
TEL AVIV – Finally, the long-sought truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has become a reality
One sarcastic posting on China's popular Web portal Tianya even went so far as to say that “CNN is of the same ilk as CCTV (China Central Television)
But can Web activism mature into a full-blown campaign for free speech without being manipulated by the government or blindfolded by Western media?
Although free speech is no panacea for China’s woes, only when it is established will the country’s progress be sustainable
That may be the most important lesson of the crisis in Tibet and Sichuan
The other half of the counter-insurgency strategy is to win the “hearts and minds” of populations that are susceptible to terrorist propaganda
The United Nations Convention on Torture explicitly forbids “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” so their use must be denied
Trying to win “hearts and minds” with Western goods simply corrupts, and thus discredits, the governments established by those intervening
Thus, this week the UN Environment Program will launch a plan for reviving the global economy while dealing simultaneously with the defining challenge of our era – climate change
But central banks make decisions that affect every aspect of society, including rates of economic growth and unemployment
Who bears it varies with different policies, and that is a decision that cannot--or at least should not--be left to central bank technocrats
Internet companies may, more than most, hide their true motives behind ersatz, democratic-sounding slogans, but in the end they are advertising products like any other
Did the Pakistanis allow Bin Laden to hide in the hope of using him as a bargaining chip in the endgame for Afghanistan?
But aggressive follow-up therapy will be required to prevent the remaining Al Qaeda cells from metastasizing by acquiring more adherents who believe in violence to achieve the 'purification' and empowerment of Islam
For if the Constitution is indeed dead, what happens next?
Perhaps when no one is looking, they are not generous at all
From an ethical perspective, however, should we care so much about the purity of the motive with which the gift was made?
One of the most significant factors determining whether people give to charity is their beliefs about what others are doing
Members of the league want to change expectations about what is a “normal” or “reasonable” amount to give
Until the late 1990’s and the advent of monetary union, most government debt in the European Union was domestically held: in 1998, foreigners held only one-fifth of sovereign debt
Even at the end, when the United Nations Security Council voted on Gaza, Bush was happy to humiliate Condoleezza Rice at Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s bidding
There will be no peace settlement otherwise

People – and their elected leaders as well -- often have the feeling that such seemingly innocent proposals are in fact part of an ominous “hidden agenda.”
LONDON – The race for the leadership of the British Labour Party isn’t normally a world-shaking event
We may not want politicians to be driven by self-interest, but we need to acknowledge that they have selves, which are formed by a multitude of factors – and passions
PRINCETON – Former US President Bill Clinton gave one of the best speeches of his life at the recent Democratic National Convention
He responded by quickly launching a frontal assault on the cartels, with the support of the army
But, beyond strategic considerations, something else must be mentioned (with prudence)
They would not mind an America that was more modest abroad and more ambitious at home
While pop music fans in China can listen to whatever they like, including Madonna singing "I'm gonna shake up the system," ordinary Chinese need courage to speak such messages aloud
An independent judiciary, financial disclosure by government officials, and other independent institutions have been essential to limiting and forestalling – though not fully eliminating – corruption in the United States and most other advanced capitalist democracies
Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires?
So expectations outpace reality, with politicians contributing to this by promising more than they can deliver--and thus losing the trust of their constituents
It recently found a new source of wealth, natural gas, but may become yet another victim of the so-called “natural resource curse.”
This has all come crashing down

The problem is that India’s defense sector has virtually nothing that it can sell to the US
Cynics may say that nothing will happen to the fundamentals of the global financial system, but they are wrong
In all likelihood, we will see huge changes in the next few years, quite possibly in the form of an international financial regulator or treaty
Such changes put pressure on universal banks to abandon riskier investment-bank activities in order to operate more freely
While Lula didn’t repeat his comparison with a football game, neither did he criticize the repression, unlike Sarkozy, who did so strongly
Public education is becoming universally available, including for groups that faced harsh discrimination in the past
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) came through last week with a larger rescue package for Brazil than world financial markets expected
The world's task is to find instruments that can minimize the possibility of moral hazard and yet keep the level of real risk within tolerable bounds
Of course, state intervention in the economy risks asphyxiating the dynamism of Brazil’s companies and private initiatives
Opponents see red at its very mention
The details of Pro-álcool involved providing incentives to several parties to participate, without which they would have sat on the sidelines
True to form, he recently announced a big increase in US food aid – good for the hungry poor and good for American farmers
Threats to life bring crowds on to the streets
Having enjoyed a few days of Bush-bashing, India got on with the job of bowing to pre-election political pressures
That's why a pause now makes good sense
The same is true of Luxembourg
But it can also stifle development

The dictator wanted all socialist citizens to live in socialist flats
Of course, you cannot “adopt” abandoned factories or the unemployed masses in the way that dogs can be adopted
The chemical industry consumes more energy than all private transportation, and aluminum production rivals the commercial sector in terms of electricity demand
Yet these five industries combined employ only 14 million people out of a total labor force of 770 million and fewer people than they did a decade ago
To many, it was a glorious moment, emblematic of the West’s victory in the Cold War, and one that seemed to come out of the blue
As Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, acutely observed, “banks are global in life, but national in death.”

Unfortunately, Cameron’s track record in European politics does not inspire confidence in his ability to manage a different outcome
Today, China is producing literary exiles at a faster rate that the Soviet Union ever achieved
China has it, and Britain and other Western countries want it
Overall, the reaction of both press and public is one of disillusion and/or cynicism
After all, what responsible public body wants to be accused of violating human rights?
The settlement reached with North Korea, whereby it will dismantle its nuclear program, and the Annapolis conference for an Israeli-Palestinian peace – with the participation of Syria, a pivotal member of the region’s “axis of evil” – are two key examples of this trend
Nevertheless, it is the Great Recession that keeps Labour in contention, particularly in the light of the Conservatives’ pledge to start cutting public spending the moment they take power
And even though inequality of wealth and income in Britain increased in the 13 years Labour has been in power, this is thought to be something that a left-wing party might seek to correct, whereas there is no similar expectation for a party of the right
The Conservative manifesto ‘An Invitation to Join the Government of Britain’ is merely a grandiloquent way of saying that under a Conservative government the people will have to look after themselves
The situation is a bit fairer today, but Cameron still has a steep hill to climb if he is to win
Likewise, mobile networks are delivering health services to the most remote areas of India
By contrast, the average level of fixed-line telecommunication penetration in developing countries is nearly 50 years behind the levels of the West
Of course, farmland is much less important than other speculative assets

So it was right to start planning for a change of gear when the recovery started to materialize
Although it seemed that Chavez would fall, oil saved him
Japan was perhaps easier to transform because it did not have an abundance of easily extractable natural resources. But land holdings were concentrated and a few large combines called "Zaibatsus" held industrial power
The easiest fix is to let foreigners in so that they can channel foreign capital into domestic private ventures
Such policies would mirror those followed by Napoleon III in France in the 1850's. Destroying the financial power of the Ancien Regime laid the foundations for the vibrant market democracy France became

News reports show that revulsion is spreading through the Arab world, where American and Israeli flags are burned side-by-side
It is not easy for a marine or soldier to construct a school or clinic when he is being fired upon, or for Iraqi moderates to risk their lives by being supportive when they have no protection against insurgents
Shouldn't America's leaders be trying to shorten the period that other societies are vulnerable to the evils that made the twentieth century the bloodiest in the history of mankind?
Wouldn't the rest of us rather minimize than maximize the time we might be faced with the problem of containing a Hindu Nationalist India, a Wilhelmine China, or a Weimar Russia?
To those in the other Arab countries of the Middle East and elsewhere who oppose the war, the impact is to make human rights seem a justification, or a pretext, for a projection of American power
Even in the high-priority defense sector, perhaps one-third of government spending is wasted or stolen – a condition that is not conducive to realizing Russia’s great power ambitions
It needs to provide an expanded form of deposit insurance during this time of turmoil, so that there are no more Northern Rock-style bank runs
Meanwhile, Hamas is seeking to capitalize on its growing popularity by winning elections
But Blix reproached Kay for his attitude
The goal was set in 2005, and last month ASEAN+3 finance ministers negotiated the details
That China is now acknowledged as a co-equal means that it will not stand in the way of further cooperation
The IMF could then be shown the door
So what might this mean in practice?
Nevertheless, the fact that it has been taken up by the world’s most famous business school is significant
The London markets have waited 18 long years already for the Bank of England to appear on their screens, and I suspect their wait will continue for some time yet. 
China's coalmines are among the most dangerous places to work in the world
Accidents were the leading cause of death among workers in dozens of hazardous industries
Of course, American industry is still plagued by serious safety problems
Other western states, such as Germany, have successfully relied on centralized regulation and social insurance systems ever since Bismarck reformed the German law of accidents in the 1880's
But does this argument really have any more basis in reality than the administration’s previous claims of an “imminent” threat from weapons of mass destruction or Saddam Hussein’s alleged support for al‑Qaeda?
After all, British citizens in one of the world’s oldest democracies carried out the recent terrorist attacks in London
While emerging economies can deal with the economic slowdown in industrial countries, the financial-sector transmission mechanism is more challenging
Fortunately, several emerging economies continue to have cushions and shock absorbers
But they do not operate in a vacuum
Why should there be any reason for hope, especially given that US environmental policy has been predicated on the unrealistic belief that relatively small subsidies to new energy technologies can substitute for tax-induced price incentives for producers and consumers?
It was this failure that brought Hamas to power
Hezbollah was initially thrilled at the outbreak of popular revolts against rulers closely allied with the US and the West

At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would increase, and unemployment would decrease
Those countries whose deficits have soared as a result of the global recession should not be forced into a death spiral – as Argentina was a decade ago
Ideological rigidity alone, however, does not explain Iran’s often-gratuitous anti-Americanism
Some prominent policymakers and analysts, however, argue that oversight aimed at identifying and stemming systemic risk is futile
Admittedly, these warnings did not add up to an ironclad case, and they certainly didn’t predict the timing of the break
What we can say is that the disease itself is the wrong enemy
Screening entails the mass testing of individuals of a certain age and gender, regardless of family history or personal health, to identify a potential disease state
Elevated PSA levels would suggest the presence of prostate cancer, even if no physical abnormalities were detected, so a tissue biopsy would be conducted
Some evidence can be found in those features of the American economy that we believe others should emulate

Our first glimpse of the trouble in coordinating an international response to the financial crisis came last November, during the emergency G-20 summit in Washington
By insisting on its voluntariness, the ECB may be trying to ensure that the restructuring is not deep; but, in that case, it is putting the banks’ interests before that of Greece, for which a deep restructuring is essential if it is to emerge from the crisis

Yet Poland, like many of the other new democracies in our region, remains stuck in the past when it comes to the humane treatment of drug users
Addressing drug use through criminalization and rehabilitation centers does nothing to curb demand, however, and usage rates have failed to decline
The changes, modeled after Germany’s progressive policies, would stop punishing people for possessing small amounts of drugs for their own use, impose stricter penalties for dealers and provide more effective treatment for drug-dependent people
This is important progress, considering that the opposition is still paying a price for its boycott of the 2005 elections that gave Chávez absolute control of Parliament

Second, it is making progress in its negotiations with the Palestinians dependent on events in Egypt and elsewhere in the region, such as Iran
While caution is certainly in order, the importance of Rouhani’s election must be recognized
WASHINGTON, DC – On June 17, at his first press conference as Iran’s President-elect, Hassan Rowhani broke little new ground in the Islamic Republic’s relations with the West
Rowhani’s supporters want a better economy and integration into the international community more than they want nuclear glory

Fang Jue, a reformer who served a four-year term for economic crimes, and Jiang Surang, an underground Catholic priest sentenced to six years for illegally publishing Bibles, were both punished in this way
We may get a better picture of China's public health system as a result of the SARS crisis, but when it comes to the country's political health, there is little to suggest that criticism will be tolerated or opposition allowed
Those who attempt to change the way China is governed will be dealt with harshly, their names and fates remaining anonymous

China has also launched a stealth war in the East China Sea to assert territorial claims over the resource-rich Senkaku Islands (called the Diaoyu Islands in China), which Japan has controlled since 1895 (aside from a period of administration by the United States from 1945 to1972)
During the 1950’s and 1960’s, Europeans amassed a huge stash of US Treasury bills in an effort to maintain fixed exchange-rate pegs, much as China has done today
China’s economic system has changed just as drastically in other ways as well
China’s real core interests are not in territorial expansion and hegemony over its neighbors, but in upholding the human rights and improving the welfare of its own citizens, which is the world’s core interest in China
Cities do not become financial centers because they are more “excellent” than other cities, or because they have done something that other cities failed to do
Investments from all over the world are flowing into Europe as a result
Though such disparities can, of course, have other causes as well, geography does seem to explain a lot
Of course, the government’s efforts alone cannot entice industrial investors to “go West,” because public infrastructure spending cannot overcome all problems
China must exercise the foresight needed to begin paying this debt now, when it is manageable, rather than allowing it to accumulate and, ultimately, threaten to bankrupt us all
Yet China is in no mood to plead poverty when dealing with the West
But China’s own constituencies, whether netizens or competing official institutions, have contributed to an international record that is earning China derision from small neighbors and great powers alike

Indeed, because standard measures of the probability of default fall when the economy is doing well and rise when it is not, capital requirements based on these measures tend to be pro-cyclical
The key feature of these measures is that they are applied differently depending on whether an asset is over- or undervalued relative to the guidance range
By contrast, wholesale restrictions on short-selling (and other such measures that pay no regard to whether an asset is over- or undervalued) – an option that some have suggested – could actually lead to greater instability
Rules that are beneficial in some circumstances may become counterproductive in others

Finally, in 1970 a splendid computer innovation enabled the proper alignment of amino acid sequences (which is vital to all subsequent data management). 
It was one of those rare moments of opportunity when an amateur could compete with professionals

My foundations have been active in educating Roma for more than 25 years
The REF is ready to help national education authorities across the EU improve their performance in educating Roma children
But, by ceding that authority to an independent central bank, the eurozone’s members put themselves in the position of a developing country that has borrowed in foreign currency
On the contrary, many capitals south of the Rio Grande had high expectations for the team that moved into the White House in 2001
But in other cases, opposition to America's preferences is wrought by public sentiment and goes against the instincts of leaders who know better
With its history, culture, and traditions – including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union – Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization
If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors’ future, who will believe in Europe tomorrow?
But Europe’s stability and commitment to economic growth across the continent require that these interests be satisfied without economic pressure or unilateral intervention
Europe, meanwhile, looked wonderfully well balanced, at least superficially, whether one considered all 27 European Union members or the 16-member eurozone
The change is evident by asking a single question: would it still be possible today to give up the D-Mark and introduce the euro as a common currency?
But a treaty change would require engaging the European public – and, in several member states, submitting the proposed revisions to popular referenda
Chancellor Schröder's job, as everyone now recognizes, was saved by floods in eastern Germany and his opportunistic crusade against America's Iraq policy
An increase in gasoline taxes is set for January 2003. Income tax relief due in 2003 has been postponed
So long as the campaign's focus was on economics, Schröder's government was a clear loser
Indeed, Edmund Stoiber's economic policies as premier of Bavaria were (and are) no less interventionist than those of Schröder
Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor
GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61% of the West German level in 1996, but it is now only 59%
On the other hand, they can decide to allow economics to prevail
From 1995 to 2004, Germany lost a total of 1.09 million full-time equivalent jobs in manufacturing and trade
My father who had been in the resistance would come back from Brandenburg prison
Success can mean failure if it is achieved with questionable tools
Women's status has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries
Indeed, the region is not poor by international standards, but rather stuck in the middle-income range between the world's poorest places and the high-income countries of North America, Europe, and East Asia
Even if the 59 million votes cast for Bush represented a ringing endorsement of his Iraq policy, it would not restore America's international credibility
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US
In 2005, the international community renewed its commitments to help the poorest countries meet the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s), which aim to halve poverty by 2015
Western diplomacy in recent years has focused on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as the key to resolving the crisis
But that shouldn’t stop the West from reaching out to him directly, or pressing him to publicly appoint the representatives who negotiate with the West
Alas, the US has shown absolutely no “concrete efforts” towards keeping this commitment
This contrasts with the 4% of GNP that the US spends on its military, roughly $500 billion this year
Instead of worrying that 70 cents per $100 is giving till it hurts, our slogan in the rich countries should be “Giving Till it Heals.”
The third target of collective action, rebalancing, has two meanings
In Europe and Japan, for example, monetary and fiscal policies have been tightening in response to domestic concerns, further slowing the world economy
However, it has also limited the expansion of domestic demand and import growth, exacerbating rather than redressing the global imbalances
There is, of course, no return to the situation that preceded the Great Crash
Higher investment and social spending in poor countries will stimulate the entire world economy, spur economic development, and promote environmental sustainability through investments in renewable energy, efficient water use, and sustainable agriculture
Europe continues to be a mixed picture, with the European Central Bank almost perversely raising interest rates even as Europe’s economy needs further stimulation to ensure its recovery
In the US, equality of opportunity has been exposed as a myth
The optimal combination of solutions will create the biggest impact for the least money
Climate engineering could remain a back-up option in case of necessity
That would be a shameful legacy – one that could be avoided by re-thinking climate policy
BAMAKO, MALI – Media organizations in wealthy countries regularly send forth reporters to find “victims of global warming.” In dispatches from the Pacific Islands, Bangladesh, or Ethiopia, journalists warn of impending calamity
When it is explained to him, he is dismissive
He has more immediate concerns: “The first thing I need is food, and then a job.”
Every two weeks, Desi walks four hours to take Michel to the health center
Say we decide to reduce CO2 emissions by three-quarters by 2100 while maintaining reasonable growth
Consequently, the proportion of hungry in the Third World has dropped from 50% in 1950 to less than 17% today, while worldwide incomes have increased more than three-fold
Globalization After the Crisis
According to the International Labor Organization, continued labor-market deterioration in 2009 may lead to an estimated increase in global unemployment of 39-61 million workers relative to 2007
In the current crisis, China, India, and certain other emerging-market countries are coping fairly well
This is why China – which appears to be faring well in the crisis, meeting its 8% growth target in 2009 – became an economic powerhouse only after instituting market-oriented reforms in the 1980s
In today’s competitive global marketplace, countries need to upgrade and diversify their industries continuously according to their changing endowments
Government compensation for such pioneering firms can speed the process
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness
In today’s world, by contrast, the nature of the actors involved is no longer so clear
Indeed, China is clearly in a category of its own, as a source of perceived (or real) risk to its regional environment
And this may very well be the case for the foreseeable future
In each instance, when the world's collective decision differed from what America wanted, President Bush insisted that America get its way
The counterpart of America's immense fiscal deficit is its yawning trade gap
Meanwhile, once recovery has set in, the huge borrowing demands of the US and Europe will almost certainly drive up real interest rates globally, posing new problems for the world's emerging markets
Ever since European clubs loosened restrictions on the number of foreign players, the game has become truly global
For the winner of the cup was not Cameroon or Cote d’Ivoire or any of the other African teams loaded with star players from European leagues, but Egypt, which fielded only four players (out of 23) who play in Europe
But then we saw protests in Tel Aviv, Santiago, London, and now even in the US
Politically, too, the process of adjustment by deflation in deficit countries is so unpleasant and difficult that many pessimists think it will ultimately prove to be unsustainable
There are also signs that individual central banks are using the leeway that they have within the existing framework in order to carry out important policy shifts
Economies in which dynamism comes from new firms historically have commercialized the radical innovations that keep pushing out the production-possibility frontier
There are countless more cases that can be mentioned
Small-scale demonstration projects prove how success can be achieved; the challenge then becomes taking the solutions “to scale” in nationwide or even worldwide programs
Rising powers can neither insulate nor isolate themselves from what happens beyond their borders
All this led to average growth rates well in excess of 4%
Perhaps leaders should be limited to one aide in the room and prohibited from reading formally prepared opening statements
Today, a growing number of writers, researchers, and policymakers see the crucial link between education and national economic success
Some 57 million children still do not go to school, 500 million girls will never finish the secondary education to which they are entitled, and 750 million adults remain illiterate
Several months later, only 4%-6% of the funds have been spent, and the federal government is brow-beating state governments – for example, demanding that California rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $7 billion in stimulus funds
Man and machine have learned to co-exist, for now
Turning away from a fight with its former occupier and historical rival would be a step backward in this six-decade-long quest
When Mao Zedong took power in 1949, his immediate goal was to re-establish the “greater China” of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), insisting that the Manchu-led empire was the permanent and enduring China
Anticipating that difficulty, companies are less willing to hire in the first place, until they are sure that long-term demand for their products is sufficient to justify long-term hires
Greece’s recent financing package, overseen by the Troika, gave the country much less debt relief than it needed
The most significant problem would be capital losses for core eurozone financial institutions
Some argue that Greece’s real GDP would be much lower in an exit scenario than it would be during the hard slog of deflation
To minimize that risk, the Troika reserves currently devoted to the Greek bailout should be used to limit exchange-rate overshooting; capital controls would help, too
Still, the European political project fell far short of the economic one
Up to a threshold of around 100 kwh per capita per day, energy consumption and human development indicators go hand in hand
One cannot rule out a couple of quarters of sharp GDP growth as the inventory cycle and the massive policy boost lead to a short-term revival
Bhutan has many things going its way
There is much talk these days about “hard” and “soft power,” about America having one and Europe the other
There is a simple prudential principle at work here: because our ability to monitor and regulate behavior is necessarily imperfect, we need to rely on a broader set of interventions
Greece, too, is turning over the reigns of government to an unelected, and supposedly apolitical, technocrat, Lucas Papademos, a former vice president of the European Central Bank
Monti, for example, was among the first to sound the alarm about Italy’s dire finances
Not surprisingly, the incidence of cholera is highest in Haiti’s slums and rural areas, where people are farthest from assistance
At the same time, our response must be viewed within the broader context of recovery and long-term development
In an unprecedented statement, Mahmoud al-Zahar, a top Hamas leader, said any missiles fired at Israel from Gaza would be “betrayal missiles.”
Though the Palestinian economy in the West Bank has improved greatly under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, this is no substitute for serious peace negotiations
The Arab League has given Egypt the lead role in bringing the two sides together, but Hamas has spurned Egypt’s proposals
Palestinians are looking instead to Iran, Hamas’ ally, for signs of any revival in discussions between Fatah and Hamas
Moreover, Hamas has announced plans to recruit 1,500 additional security personnel for the West Bank, Fatah’s stronghold
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it
When Arab states met to discuss the Gaza crisis, Saudi Arabia vetoed any action
The violence has included civil wars among Palestinians and Algerians; the bloodshed in Iraq; and terrorist campaigns in Egypt and Saudi Arabia
Hamas will use all means necessary to protect its power, and to break the jihadi groups now spreading in Gaza
Every year, more than one million additional workers enter America's labor force, and a functioning economy must find jobs for them
Indeed, the focus on zero can be misleading
We at the Research Foundation for Science, Technology, and Ecology used the law to stop Monsanto’s commercialization of Bt cotton in 1999, which is why approval was not granted for commercial sales until 2002
As food supply growth slowed, demand continued to grow, and not only due to population increase
In addition, more securitization, easier online trading, and other financial market developments in recent years have facilitated greater speculative investments, especially in commodity futures and options markets, including those affecting food
Still, it must be noted that negative output growth for more than two years is a relatively rare event, even in the aftermath of severe banking crises
A number of leaders, most prominently German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are understandably worried about the longer-term consequences of aggressive macroeconomic stimulus
True, China could bring the US to its knees by threatening to sell its dollar holdings

While peak oil theorists have strong views about that, they do not allow for all the current and future technological possibilities that might increase resources
Netanyahu and Abbas both showed once again how the politics surrounding “the peace process” has defeated the cause of peace
But demilitarization, the deployment of international forces, and rigid security arrangements could offer an answer
For example, your occasional illusionary perception of your name spoken in a crowd occurs because this utterance is uniquely important
The fund grosses $11 million from the sale of the options plus 4% on $110 million in Treasury bills, which represents a handsome 15.4% return before expenses

·    With the approaching end of the Bush presidency and uncertainty about his successor’s policy, the window of opportunity for Israeli action is seen as potentially closing
As open economies, Belgium and the Netherlands have both been interested in developing the internal market, while differing in their methods
In 1991, when the Netherlands held the European presidency, Belgium supported its far-reaching draft for a treaty of European Union
But others generally see it as the largest of the small
As she said in a pre-trip speech at the Asia Society in New York, “Collaboration on clean energy and greater efficiency offers a real opportunity to deepen the overall US-Chinese relationship.”
On her first Asian trip in February, she provided a welcome contrast to the past with her openness to others’ views, her willingness to cooperate, and her star power
After decades of autocracy, this vast archipelago of a country just concluded a presidential election that has solidified its transition to democracy
So diplomatic efforts must instead aim to join Americans and like-minded Asians in common cause, to push for steps forward in the medium to longer term
A historical perspective on bridge building or any other engineering specialty provides a caveat about how our humanity affects our thinking
As such, its development into ever longer spans is following the historic pattern that in the past has led to failures
It is not only in central banking, of course, that we see the role of historical experience in shaping policymaking
Given the evolution of American strategic thinking after Iraq (and now Afghanistan), and of Israel’s strategic thinking after Lebanon, a preventive strike is highly unlikely
The dilemma concerning Iran is whether a power imbued with an “absolute” ideology can be allowed to be in control of an “absolute” weapon
Some have even embraced explicit policies to boost asset prices (e.g., the US Federal Reserve’s second round of so-called “quantitative easing”)
Most importantly, too many government and household balance sheets remain out of equilibrium in an excessively asset-based global economy
Already-large disparities in income and wealth will continue to deepen, amplified by higher inflation and financial repression. And debt and deficit concerns will remain, with the virtual certainty of at least one sovereign-debt restructuring in Europe
As much as we may wish for a more reassuring outlook, the world economy will remain unusually fluid in the coming years
The first thing that many people ask about charities is, “How much of my donation is spent on administration?”
They were in their mid-twenties, earning six-figure incomes at an investment company – more than they needed – and were thinking about donating money to help make the world a better place
They invited charities to apply for grants of $25,000 in five broad humanitarian categories, with the application process demanding the kind of information that they had been seeking
It is time for a civilizing mission that will emerge from society itself and bring people together
Ahmedinejad’s purpose is simple: find the weak spots in the chain that links Europe to its past and, through this past, to Israel and the US
They should be proud--and a little humble--about their magnetic quality, as the US was for a long time
Today, the number of people who have been internally displaced by conflicts alone is twice that of refugees
Insecurity in Iraq is most strikingly illustrated by the number of people fleeing their homes
"Effeminate" men and "masculine" women coincide perfectly with the popular view of homosexuals as men who are not "real" men and women who are not fully "feminine."
But this has implications that go far beyond the rejection of homosexuality, because heterosexuals are also affected by it
The survey also showed that although China's government ruled out universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections, over 40% of respondents still wanted democracy by then, with nearly 20% more wanting it by the next round of elections in 2011 and 2012
Indeed, Mr Tung's anticipatory subservience to the real or imagined wishes of China's rulers exposed the congenital flaw in the political architecture of uniting a liberal society with a dictatorship
The base-load power, too, is predominantly based on fossil fuels, with around 39% of global electricity generation sourced from burning coal
They know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong
They want to see their institutions and values mirrored and replicated in their neighbors – a dynamic that builds loyalty
It wants to remain engaged with the entire world, not just some islands off the European coast
But today opinions are fragmented across a broad range of positions – a situation that also cries out for leadership
Only when one or more parties to the conflict reject it has the moment arrived to consider a serious effort to arm some of the combatants
Despite his past, Lula promised not to disrupt Brazilian corporate capitalism, running with a market-oriented vice president
Revelations of malfeasance have also come from the governments of New York (Attorney General Elliott Spitzer) and Massachusetts (Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin)
In the short-term, dollar depreciation does not affect supply and demand, but it does affect speculation and investment in oil futures markets
Several factors have prevented high oil prices from affecting the demand for petroleum products in the US in recent years, such as increased government spending, low interest rates, tax breaks, and an increase in real incomes
Germany certainly became assertive, owing mostly to the social pressures and tensions incited by rapid economic growth
Economic historians, meanwhile, argued that future textbooks would embed analysis of recent experience in the longer-term historical record
Technological progress will be incremental rather than revolutionary
The relationship between political economy and policy analysis is not at all like this
What enabled reform was not a reconfiguration of political power, but the emergence of new strategies
The country can no longer play the role of transatlantic mediator between France and America
Germany is by no means the only sinner here, for US diplomacy over Iraq was often clumsy and bombastic
After Hurricane Gilbert, remittances increased by 25 cents for each dollar of hurricane damage that households incurred
Or maybe the damage from the hurricane was simply too large for migrants to cover completely
A high school diploma was sufficient for office workers 40 years ago, whereas an undergraduate degree is barely sufficient today
But the education system has been unable to provide enough of the labor force with the necessary education
But when lots of easy money pushed by a deep-pocketed government comes into contact with the profit motive of a sophisticated, competitive, and amoral financial sector, matters get taken far beyond the government’s intent
This has not yet happened, as central banks have been careful to repeat their mantra of low long-term inflation
Achieving these goals requires fulfilling several conditions
Eighty years on, the developed world has approached Keynes’s goal

This is the only realistic way to help those – probably a majority – who want genuine democracy, not an election used as a route to domination
And the forces that made intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq so difficult are of course the very forces at the heart of the storm today
Central banks should put a floor under the value of a country’s banking system by committing to buy shares in an index fund of bank stocks at a predetermined price
Individual banks would rise or fall in importance based on their value relative to the market index of all banks in the fund
Nor are European ministers, still struggling to catch up with reality, yet considering involuntary debt exchanges
In short, the stimulus will strengthen America’s economy, but it is probably not enough to restore robust growth

The global campaign for debt relief for poor countries was led by non-governmental organizations that successfully mobilized young people in rich countries to put pressure on their governments
Burma has a very different internal political dynamic, not least because of the complex relationships among its various ethnic and linguistic communities – social cleavages that were not an issue in largely homogeneous Poland’s transition
In Egypt, for example, if the number of female workers were raised to the same level as that of men, the country’s GDP could grow by 34%
Against this background, government tax and spending policies, as well as labor-market regulation, should be reformed to help boost female employment
But if we have already made that decision, why don’t we just do it?
There is ample evidence that restrictions on immigration in one country divert migrant flows to other EU countries, and that migration is attracted by generous welfare entitlements
This approach has been successfully implemented in Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland; Germany and Great Britain are following suit
In international negotiations, there is always a way forward if the benefits of an agreement are shared by all
BERKELEY – Three years into the financial crisis, one might think that the world could put Great Depression analogies behind it

The proposal mirrors the UK plan – the investment-banking and trading arms, not the retail side, would be ring-fenced – but the end point would be quite similar
A more difficult issue for Hu could be intellectual property rights
However, while the US government and American companies question whether the Chinese are willing and able to enforce such rights, one must put this issue into historical perspective

In the run up to the election, many Indians could not believe that an African-American would ever be chosen to reside in the White House
Nigeria is India’s largest trading partner in Africa
China was clearly able for many years to exploit a “reserve army of the unemployed” à la Karl Marx – to grow rapidly without facing a labor-supply constraint, so that capital accumulation would not run into diminishing returns

But, while it is comfortable to live in the social-democratic world of Scandinavia, Germany, and other European countries, many of them have purchased their equality on credit from future generations
Both raise quite difficult practical questions, though they are clear in principle
One difficult question is where, exactly, to draw the line that defines the basic status to which all citizens are entitled
Nevertheless, while a free society recognizes limits to inequality, it also accepts that inequality exists, for it provides hope for many by showing what one might achieve with ability and luck – or perhaps even luck alone
I can also envision alternatives that would have enriched poor nations: Deng Xiaoping becoming China’s leader in 1956 rather than 1976 would have done the job there
Securitization, structured finance, and other innovations have so interwoven the financial system’s various players that it is essentially impossible to restructure one financial institution at a time

If we think of the Arab revolutions, there are many surprises yet to come
Even more crucial has been the enormous drop in the cost of transmitting information, which reduces barriers to entry
Indeed, investigations have shown that the risk of developing breast cancer is roughly doubled in females with a family history of breast cancer
Recently, new approaches to investigating genes involved in DNA repair, and huge studies of the effect of SNP on breast cancer risk, have identified two classes of breast cancer susceptibility factors
In addition, reliable risk prediction models are required to learn more about the combined effect of certain patterns of susceptibility factors on overall lifetime risk and response to therapy, including their role as objects of targeted therapies
Above all, innovation will blossom wherever it is recognized that innovation must be open to the physical world and to the world of ideas, and that, because no firm, no process, and no invention has a guaranteed future, everyone should be prepared for uncertainty
Here, too, the formulation of new ideas and hypotheses quite often takes place at a far remove from the authority of experts, because experts, like business managers, often become prisoners of their specializations and backgrounds

If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use the weapons in an adventurous manner
Moreover, dealing with such an openly extreme Iran – radical even by the hardline regime’s standards – will be a challenge not just for the US, but for Europe as well
Since the president has no authority over these issues, any disagreement between the Supreme Leader and the next president will place the president in a difficult position with no real power
But, on the big issues of foreign policy, relations with the West, and the nuclear program, the identity of the president is not important
His economic failures have highlighted the need for a more moderate and capable president
The IAEA’s job is to determine whether a nation has violated its safeguards agreement, and El-Baradei has made it abundantly clear that Iran has
Iran could also build trust if it became more transparent, particularly about its own strategic ambitions
Khaled Mashal, Hamas’s overall leader, who lives under Syrian protection in Damascus, traveled to Tehran, where he received some $50 million in badly needed cash
As for the impact on lives in Gaza, Hamas – like Yasir Arafat – has again shown itself to be more devoted to the idea of Palestine than to the welfare of Palestinians
For the most part, the two men have avoided head-on confrontation
Consumed with their test of wills, they are unable to make well-informed and nuanced decisions in their dealings with outsiders
To answer, one needs to understand the composition of the Iranian electorate
The current president comes out of the IRGC (specifically, the Ramazan Unit of the Quds Force), and has used that organization and the Basij to help consolidate his power by moving against more liberal political opponents
But the halting and weak response to Katrina has called this into question
Katrina has also raised questions about other items on the president’s agenda
The real question for Bush’s role in history remains Iraq
But right now, the prospects look dubious
Absent such confidence, Iraq’s oil output will not approach its potential, which will only widen the gap between global supply and demand
True autonomy for Japan, as in the past, depends once more on active and cooperative engagement in containing a world crisis
The first of these will be the length of time that it takes the victors to form a new government
As a result, government expenditures and household incomes are up substantially since Saddam Hussein’s last years in power
Iraq is already one of the largest recipients of US assistance ever
But America's economic program for reconstructing Iraq is laying the foundations for poverty and chaos
It is not a matter of ill will on the part of these countries; they simply cannot afford to extend these services
The crisis did provide doctors with some greater understanding of how to detect methyl mercury poisoning
Yet the Red Crescent and other relief agencies have been unable to relieve Falluja’s civilian population
The mood in EU capitals is one of nervousness as polling day looms, with the future of the EU in the hands of Ireland’s unpredictable voters
Foreign direct investment accounts by more than 1,000 overseas companies translates into 145,000 jobs in Ireland, 70% of total exports, and €2.8 billion in corporate-tax receipts
Irish recovery cannot occur without European recovery
Messianic waves from the Middle East, reaching both schools and mosques, help draw young Muslims into radicalism
They may now seek a deeper connection to their Muslim identity, but, having learned to question authority, they are unlikely to accept rigid parental or Islamic traditions
But should universities now reduce their demands in order to meet the needs of the larger society, not least in terms of their carbon footprint?
In October 2009, an initial understanding was reached, according to which Iranian low-enriched uranium (LEU) would be delivered to Russia for further enrichment and conversion into fuel rods for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR)
But the US hasless power - in the sense of control over other countries' internal behavior - than Britain did when it ruled a quarter of the globe
The US spends nearly seventeen times as much on its military, and there is little indication that this is about to change
BERKELEY – In the United States, the scent of decline is in the air
It also failed to adopt precision machinery that depended on electricity, which prevented it from producing machined components for use in assembling typewriters, cash registers, and motor vehicles
The typical bank is capitalized with equity, long-term debt, short-term debt, and deposits
Of course, such distinctions do not matter much to the religious fanatics who rejoice in the murder of Salman Taseer
If China had let its currency float back then, it would have depreciated in value, deepening the crisis
If China comports itself well, and if the meetings are productive, this will be important in its own right
CAMBRIDGE – The twenty-first century is witnessing Asia’s return to what might be considered its historical proportions of the world’s population and economy
But is there any reason to believe that new loans will go to worthy projects rather than to politically connected borrowers?
One way or the other, the financial crisis is likely to slow medium-term Chinese growth significantly
Of course, foreign investment in the TAR is a drop in the ocean relative to that in China as a whole
Activists cannot possibly take aim at all foreign businesses in China, so most firms are unlikely to be specifically targeted or suffer reputational damage
When she mentioned the book’s title to American friends, they wondered why she used the modifier “fragile,” whereas Chinese friends said calling their country a “superpower” was premature. 
Japan no longer focuses on exporting finished goods to Europe and North America, but on exporting parts and components for assembly in China
This public outrage also incited political change
The United Nations' Arab Human Development Report is frank in its criticism of the region's economic and social progress
PHILADELPHIA – Polio broke out in Central Asia this year, with 560 cases reported in Tajikistan
Four cases were reported in an Amish community in Minnesota in 2005, and many others have been reported in recent years in Angola, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Benin, India, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan, and elsewhere
Surveys indicate that business confidence is up throughout the euro-zone economy, indicating that a domestic investment boom may be around the corner
The recent election in Italy of a center-left government led by Romano Prodi is a case in point
[Thus,] GDP would be higher than otherwise by $120 billion in 2009 and $180 billion in 2010...,” and by $60 billion in 2011
The long-term nominal and real Treasury rates continue to be absurdly low, so much so that I rub my eyes whenever I see them
It follows that an additional stimulus package in 2010 would be another mistake...”
Regardless of its prospects, CAFTA is far from a done deal, and it at least opens the way for more discussion and debate
In many countries, however, political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates
In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision
A useful reserve currency must be limited in supply, but have sufficient elasticity to satisfy the large, unpredictable needs that may arise in a turbulent financial world
If increased reproduction is the ultimate end all and be all of evolution by natural selection, then altruists should disappear – and fast
 hive. And their hive contained special individuals: blood relatives. 
From that point on, no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do, or has what it takes, to fight and win another general election for Labour
WASHINGTON, DC – The geography of poverty and social deprivation has changed dramatically over the last two decades
Legislation, courts, and law-enforcement mechanisms have failed to address the high incidence of violence against women
If more girls had gone to school a generation ago, millions of infant deaths could have been averted each year, and tens of millions of families could have been more educated, healthier, and happier
Our ordinary standards of decency and righteousness cannot always be applied - but not because cynicism and hypocrisy are all that matter in politics
History is not an idyll and politicians' biographies do not read like the lives of the saints
Indeed, throughout the 1990s, despite rising output, deflation occurred, which means that India's potential output is expanding
Germany’s labor costs fell relative to the rest of the eurozone, and its exports and GDP growth exploded
This will not be easy or quick, but it beats having corrosively high levels of inequality of opportunity, as well as a large segment of the population dependent on transfers
In past decades, large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth
Sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the Fed’s combination of liquidity, safety, and yield to expanding the quantity of private lending
Though it is possible to sympathize with the Ghanaians, who were placed in a very awkward position, the indictment intensified demands for Taylor’s removal
Perseverance in error does not correct the error; it merely exacerbates it
The Koizumi government ought to take note
In advanced economies, Keynesian economics is the bread and butter of economic forecasting and policy making
Economics is a difficult subject, because we cannot conduct controlled experiments
The crisis consists in nothing less than an effort by the major drug cartels to tame and suborn the Mexican state, and not just in the strip along the United States border, though the epicenter of the crisis is there
It is true that the number of large-scale inter-state wars continues to decline, and fighting is unlikely among advanced democracies and on many issues
This new “hyper-realism” has little in common with old-style realism
Security forces recently intercepted suicide bombers entering Iraqi Kurdistan from Iran, with, Kurdish leaders believe, the support and training of Iranian intelligence
But although Russians dislike the powerful, and cherish underdogs and martyrs, a man in jail no longer looks strong
They have little choice but to resist, and their strength should not be underestimated. The battle for Russian democracy is joined anew
That depends on who you ask
One day, it will no longer be possible to disguise unemployment through shorter working weeks, forced leaves of absence, and decreases in wages
Some of it will be saved. American household saving has shot up from 0% to 5% since the start of the recession, understandably to pay off debt
Extra hundreds of billions of dollars have been injected into banks worldwide by this means
The first is that stimulus packages around the world arrested the slide into depression, and may have started a modest recovery.  
Syria, whose secular, militarized dictatorship most closely resembles the fallen regimes of Tunisia and Egypt, may not be next in line, but appears nonetheless to be approaching a tipping point
When the regime cracks down on the Internet, people use proxy servers
Computers have burrowed inside conventional products and become embedded systems
Rapidly falling prices and extremely elastic demand will sustain rapid growth in these sectors' share of total economic expenditure
Perhaps most importantly, market relations contribute to international peace by creating ever-wider forms of association
Today an inflation rate of close to zero is the accepted goal of US policy
Although the top rate has climbed back to near 40%, no one proposes a return to pre-Reagan levels
Most earlier recessions were not entirely undesired: higher unemployment helped reduce inflation when it exceeded the Fed's comfort level
When productivity grows slowly, it is extremely unlikely that rising production will be accompanied by falling employment
But there is no universal rulebook; different countries achieve these ends differently
If there is a new Washington consensus, it is that the rulebook must be written at home, not in Washington
Significantly, these majorities existed in Muslim countries as well
In the general election in March 2004 – the first since Mahathir stepped down after 22 years in power – moderate Muslims helped Abdullah Badawi to a landslide victory
So religion cannot be imposed; individuals must practice it according to their own decisions
The linguistic dominance of Arabic throughout the Middle East and North Africa, together with pan-Arabism, reinforced weak national identities
Multiculturalism in Britain has entrenched almost self-contained Muslim communities and turned Islam into a badge of identity to counteract exclusion
But becoming a murderous fanatic like Merah or Sidique Khan is the personal choice of a pathological mind, not the trend of a generation
More broadly, Islam has failed to supersede other identity patterns, such as class and economic status
Religious moderation, if not secularization, remains the key not only to social integration, but also to Muslims’ opportunity to influence Europe’s future
The fatwas (legal opinions concerning Islamic law) that they issue appear unreasonable and cannot be accepted by those with scientific knowledge
One of these struggles is taking place among Muslims themselves over the shape of reform within their own societies
Thus, a sharp, focused challenge to the assertions of religious orthodoxy has emerged in the work of such important thinkers as Abdolkarim Soroush (Iran), Abdelmajid Charfi (Tunisia), Fazlur Rahman (Pakistan), and Mahmud Muhammad Taha (Sudan)
In the decades since, many Chinese remained suspicious of political parties with ties to the former national liberation movements
Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia, a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity to the nation-state
But the personal security they crave, and which Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are achieving, is as far away as ever
Indeed, Indonesia is unlikely any time soon to produce a leader they can depend upon in ways that Malaysia's Chinese now rely upon Premier Mahathir
The forms of religiosity in Islam today are more or less the same as those found in Catholicism, Protestantism, and even Judaism
Muhammad Atta, Zacharias Moussaoui, and Kamel Daoudi were "born again" in Marseilles, London, and Montreal, not in Egypt or Morocco (and they all broke ties with their families)
This creates a flexible adjustment mechanism, should unanticipated shocks occur
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The commodity boom in some Muslim countries has generated surpluses that need to be allocated through financial intermediaries and sovereign wealth funds
The world again witnessed a bloody and senseless surge of violence between Israel and Hamas, in which the main victims were innocent civilians maimed and killed on both sides
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his colleagues know perfectly well that UN recognition by itself will not deliver an end to occupation and the full realization of a sovereign Palestine
Only negotiated agreement on all of the critical outstanding issues – boundary definition, Jerusalem, security guarantees for Israel, and refugees – can do that
Morocco, Algeria, and Libya are hardly partners for such regional cooperation, which is also the case for most Arab countries in the Middle East
Israel also joined NATO’s naval control system in the Mediterranean, contributing to Operation Active Endeavor by joining NATO forces in patrolling the Mediterranean
The Oslo Accords divided the occupied territories into three regions. Palestinians took charge of the most densely populated urban areas, while Israel maintained total military and administrative control over the largest territory, “Area C,” which makes up 61% of the West Bank
The symbolic decision on statehood, followed by Abbas’s exit, will mark the end of the process that began in Oslo, and that has been undermining Palestinian aspirations for nearly two decades
The left offered big concessions and was ready to take high risks for the sake of peace
In addition, the world didn’t reward Israel for making concessions and taking risks
As a result, any real changes affecting the status of Jerusalem, the Golan Heights or West Bank settlements are a long way off
Rarely in history has a national movement marched to its Promised Land with such a brilliant display of diplomatic savoir-faire and military skill as the Zionists did on their way to statehood
Of course, Jews’ historical experience is not conducive to easy conciliation
Israel has simply stopped seeking to reconcile its Jewish identity with its commitment to democracy, for it has stopped addressing the contradiction that the Israeli-Palestinian question represents
As a result, the Israeli state seems to be moving closer to its Asian counterparts, with their emphasis on economic innovation and their indifference to universal values or, for that matter, peace
It has moved into its own orbit
Everyone knew that Kadima would win and form a coalition with the moderate left Labor party, which managed a respectable second-place finish
This is where Israel stands today, facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments
A byproduct of this strategy, combined with ongoing Palestinian attacks, has been growing international sympathy with Israel
Nevertheless, the national consensus has shifted, shaking all assumptions about Israeli politics
It is one thing for colonies to blow up on the other side of the world
This challenge has become more interesting with European countries’ willingness to deal with a united Palestinian government that includes Hamas’ Hanieh
Getting to the future, it seems, does not require the help of futurists
Certainly Konrad Adenauer was successful in the 1950s with his politics of Western integration, and so was Willy Brandt with his Ostpolitik in the early 1970s. But these were sustainable strategies, not tactical pirouettes
Today, German strength is not a matter of concern; German weakness is
Therefore, it's a pity that the German voters refused to endow the new Berlin government with a clear mandate to start fighting against the army of domestic veto powers
However, the Bundesbank has entered a new regime in which it will have to borrow extensively from the private banking sector to absorb the flight money from the crisis countries
Growth in the eurozone has turned negative overall, significantly so in the south
Italy is the only debt-distressed eurozone country in which the negative competitiveness trends (productivity relative to income) have not reversed direction in the post-crisis period
Adjustment mechanisms are needed, but external devaluation and inflation are not available, while labor mobility is partial at best
Unfortunately, the new law – hastily enacted at the last minute of the previous legislature – has a silly formulation that does not guarantee an equally safe majority in the Senate
He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes, including real estate, oil, timber, private equity, and venture capital and buyout firms
Few programs are targeted carefully enough to real needs – or to the really needy – as politicians buy votes by spreading coverage far beyond what is needed to achieve programs’ stated goals
Eventually, on the 50th anniversary of Japan’s defeat in 1995, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama responded with personal language of both “deep remorse” and “heartfelt apology.”
In about five years, all baby boomers will be over 65, but pressure on government expenditures for pensions and health care is expected to start sooner, around 2013
The benefits and burdens of international affairs must become subjects of open debate in the Japanese Diet
Obviously, calls for greater balance in historical education raise the specter of reactionary overkill: either complete affirmation of past Japanese conduct or other forms of anti-Chinese bias
In attempting to fulfill these inconsistent pledges, government spending this year will reach an all-time high of ¥92.3 trillion
But there is a real risk that the government will mistake this measure for the end of the reform process
So grim has Japan’s fiscal position become that bond issuance has exceeded tax revenue since 2009
Light-water reactors (LWRs) like those at Fukushima, which use water as a primary coolant, produce most of the world’s nuclear power
As global warming brings about a rise in average temperatures and ocean levels, inland reactors will increasingly contribute to, and be affected by, water shortages
While the appeal of nuclear power has declined considerably in the West, it has grown among the so-called “nuclear newcomers,” which brings with it new challenges, including concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons
The puncturing of Japan's asset bubble of the late 1980s merely brought these chickens home to roost
If, on the other hand, enough people realize that the old ways are the problem, rather than the solution, democratic reforms will still have a fighting chance
After the wave passed, a chaotic mountain of debris was all that was left of Kamaishi, Japan’s oldest steel-manufacturing town, in Iwate prefecture
Hearn’s depiction of the Meiji-Sanriku earthquake, which in 1896 took 22,000 lives in the same region as the recent quake, was later included in elementary school textbooks under the title of “The Burning of the Rice Field.”
The villagers who gather on the hill to put out the fire soon see below them the tsunami wreaking havoc on their town
To be sure, the DPJ lacks a majority in the upper house, which has the power to veto major legislation, and the last two DPJ governments have suffered from four upper-house censure resolutions against cabinet ministers
He promised to remove the base from Okinawa, and, at the same time, was obliged by the countries’ bilateral agreement to build a replacement facility there
One reason for a rise in the interest rate would be a shift from low deflation to low inflation
Together with other factions, Tanaka commanded a majority within the LDP and remained the party’s kingmaker and string-puller in successive LDP governments, perfecting the LDP’s quasi-social-democratic combination of export-led growth and pork-barrel wealth redistribution
Remarkably, Japanese savers soak up some 95% of their government’s debt
But, as the smoke dissipates from that vote, it has become clear that the real victor is neither the leading opposition Democratic Party (DPJ) nor the electorate
This followed other minor scandals concerning the misuse of political funds, which had led to two resignations and the suicide of one of Abe’s cabinet ministers
Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts, which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and big business elites
Japan’s one-party state, under the conservative LDP, was a product of World War II and the Cold War
The debate is centered on whether to increase the consumption tax in order to sustain the country’s severely strained social security system
The LDP has tried to placate public wrath about a series of political scandals and policy mistakes over the last two years, while the DPJ has attempted to capitalize on these
The frontrunner is Taro Aso, the LDP secretary general, who wants economic pump-priming
Especially in Germany, the Energiewende (the shift away from nuclear energy following the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011) has led to an increase in coal consumption
Greenhouse-gas emissions may have dropped as a consequence of reduced production amid the economic recession, but the coal resurgence does not bode well for future targets
But population density and water scarcity will certainly be inhibiting factors in their exploitation
The second explanation is that there is agreement on the goal but not on the means
Keynesians argue that Europe would grow if only policy were focused on generating aggregate demand; they blame precipitous fiscal consolidation and insufficiently aggressive monetary easing for the loss of momentum
Their opponents, by contrast, see structural weaknesses and internal imbalances as the major impediment to growth; for supply-siders, it is the slow pace of economic and social reforms that is to blame
In their widely discussed 2012 book Why Nations Fail, the economist Daron Acemoglu and the political scientist James A. Robinson emphasize the importance of inclusive political and economic institutions
If a star basketball player reacts a split-second faster than his competitors, no one has a problem with his earning more for every game than five factory workers do in a year
But the political economy of what levels of income differences countries will tolerate remains uncharted territory
There is cruel irony in the observation that in the country which Jinnah created in the name of Islam, that noble faith itself now constitutes the principal challenge to the very survival of the state
A similar scenario is already unfolding in Iraq
A solution to the Palestinian problem would serve such a strategy
We call this "monetary policy."
Einstein may have drawn US President Franklin Roosevelt’s attention to the possibility of making nuclear weapons, but he is chiefly remembered for his profound ideas about the nature of the universe
So science must retain its claim to being natural philosophy, too
This evidence should be used more aggressively by donors to discriminate amongst receivers
ROME – Every year, we waste or lose 1.3 billion metric tons of food – one-third of the world’s annual food production
Businesses and households alike should monitor where and how they waste food and take corrective steps, because prevention of wastage is even more important than recycling or composting
Such procedures have proved to be arbitrary and capricious, with no systemic way to reconcile incompatible rulings issued by different panels
It is the investment agreements themselves that most seriously threaten democratic decision-making
With a return to output growth, the recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction – is officially over
As far as international human rights law is concerned, the Bush administration has been silent
But its fundamental position is that treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are not self-executing
But few predicted last year's SARS epidemic, a pneumonia caused by acoronavirus
The virus is not well adjusted to the chicken, and some strains of the virus "go berserk."
Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their part--abiding by these principles themselves, and giving each other, and America, a shove in the right direction
Habré, who brutalized this impoverished country from 1982 to 1990, was then living safely in a seaside villa across the continent in Senegal, enjoying the $14 million he reportedly looted from the treasury on his way into exile
Often, political leaders and military and security elites have proven as shrewd and tenacious in avoiding justice as they showed themselves cunning and brutal in doing injustice
Some may still call it the “rule of law,” but it would not be a rule of law that protects the weak against the powerful
THE HAGUE – In 1993, atrocities committed against Slavic Muslims near the Bosnian silver-mining town of Srebrenica catalyzed demands to establish a tribunal to try political and military leaders accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia
But now suppose that the economist goes on to argue that, therefore, it would be silly to give patients penicillin, because we know that 98% of all treatable diseases were cured by tradicines, and penicillin is not a tradicine
Corporate status enabled universities to raise their own institutionally earmarked funds, which were bestowed on individuals who were "incorporated" on a non-hereditary basis, through examination or election. 
 century on, American graduates were cultivated as "alumni" who regard their university experience as a life-defining process to be shared, and thus worthy of receiving financial support from them. 
It contained provisions that would have removed excessive presidential powers and given Kenyans a stronger bill of rights
Developing successful strategies will require abandoning long-held assumptions that worked in the past, but that have become counterproductive myths today
One such myth is that it is best to tackle one problem at a time with straightforward, targeted solutions
Against this view, Keynes pointed out that interest-rate reductions may not do the job, because at zero or near-zero rates investors hoard cash rather than lend it out
Moreover, the main oil exporters are unwilling to subordinate their investment policies to market requirements
For example, after China, India, and Pakistan began cracking down on illicit organ markets, many patients turned to the Philippines
My colleagues and I suggest a system in which compensation is provided by a third party (government, a charity, or insurance) with public oversight
What better way to mark World Kidney Day than for global health leaders to take a bold step and urge countries to experiment with donor rewards?
These charges need to be investigated if President Medvedev’s claims to want a society based on the rule of law are not to ring hollow
Two days after making that gloomy assessment, the French chief of the defense staff, General Jean-Louis Georgelin, followed suit
Yet at the recent NATO summit in Budapest, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on NATO members to provide more troops for missions in Afghanistan
Obama has that said he would send troops from Iraq as an urgent priority
Obama has made it a campaign issue to criticize the Bush administration for neglecting Afghanistan and diverting resources needed there to the misguided war in Iraq
Only Yeltsin did things differently
Added to the winners in single-seat constituencies--half the total--this would ensure it a sturdy majority of 250 to 270 of the Duma's 450 seats
The cabinet of ministers affirmed the succession of Sabah al-Sabah as the new ruler, which was then ratified by Parliament
Currently, there are 25 constituencies nationwide, but reformers have long argued that a smaller number – each with a larger number of voters – would be less susceptible to manipulation by the political elite
As the economics of climate change has become ever clearer, warnings from the global warming community have become shriller
Ukraine followed, but, owing to internal discord, Kremlin pressure, and the European Union’s indifference, the Orange Revolution was unable to deliver on the promise of democracy

More than that, the arrest of DSK was supposedly revenge for France’s protection of another man accused of sexual crimes, Roman Polanski, and for the French ban on the burqa
In Japan, sexual harassment of women has sometimes been excused (by Japanese males) to foreigners as part of Japanese culture
Men who wish to maintain their control over women will no doubt continue to use culture and religious tradition to justify their dominance
The euro crisis has challenged the view that the transition to a multi-reserve regime will have a smooth dynamic
During the immediate postwar occupation, US military planners had to impose new currency regimes and central banking institutions
An opening for talks between Serbia and Kosovo was created by a joint European Union-Serbia resolution at the United Nations, which sets out a framework for dialogue

Go ethanol the candidates agree
Beyond improving public accounts, a large part of the revenues from high commodity prices were used to increase public spending, although this proportion varied from country to country
At one extreme stands Argentina, with the largest increase in public spending relative to GDP in Latin America (almost ten points)
Colombia has successfully implemented an alternative judicial system using “Community Boards” that deal with land title disputes
The result of these experiments reminds one of the rueful saying: the operation was a success, but the patient died
Nevertheless, profound economic and political transformation in Latin America has masked a deep disparity between reforms and reality – indeed, between hopes and their fulfillment
The problem does not lie with our shortcomings, but with the way we choose to resolve them
But government has a central role to play in the debate over the creation of democracy – one more important than its oversight of fiscal matters
As the political scientist Samuel Huntington has said, “Business may bring communities closer but it cannot bring them into harmony.”
SANTIAGO – Regional integration is usually regarded as a way for countries to strengthen themselves
Similar diagnoses are made with respect to the Latin American Economic System (SELA), the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), and other regional organizations
Oscar Arias is winning in Costa Rica
This could rekindle security dilemmas and degenerate into uncontrolled conflicts
Latin America's rich and middle classes are particularly adept at shifting their wealth to tax havens at the slightest sign that tax collection may become tougher
Today – sometimes across borders, sometimes within them – once-unthinkable wealth exists alongside extreme poverty and all its social ills
This recent growth has been fueled by a strong boom in commodity prices, including not only energy inputs such as oil, gas and coal, but also metals, minerals, and agricultural products
These markets have been insulated in part because most investment in real estate-backed securities has come from local investors who often need to invest in local-currency markets
Standard &amp; Poor’s analyst Juan Pablo de Mollein points out that Mexico does not have a liquid secondary market where mortgage securities can be traded to buyers who are far removed from the original issuer
My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been compromised
Because most of China’s outward FDI is from state-owned enterprises (SOEs), suspicions of non-commercial motivations are widespread
Chinese FDI, like all FDI, can provide host countries with a bundle of tangible and intangible assets needed for economic growth and development

Second, Americans don’t demand that immigrants regard their cultural or ethnic background as being in contrast to or in opposition to their American-ness
In Iraq, about 60% are Shia, 20% are Sunni Arabs, and 20% are Kurds, who are mostly Sunni
Though some of Iraq’s conservative local clerics wield considerable influence, its current leaders will resist any drive to transform the country into a socially repressive and isolated state
Nor is it clear whether Maliki will finally end the de-Baathification process – another major source of tension
But the initial euphoria that accompanied the so-called “Orange Revolution” quickly faded, and Ukraine is still dealing with the political and economic fallout
Despite Lopez Obrador’s best efforts to create chaos in the streets with public demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of protesters, domestic and international confidence remains strong
Indeed, while Lopez Obrador continues to denounce the outcome and has threatened to make Mexico ungovernable, Mexico’s growing middle class has taken the political conflict in stride
That political settlement has not occurred
But back in America, the belief that the surge “worked” is now leading many to argue that more troops are needed in Afghanistan
But experience and intuition can be supplemented by analytics, which is the purpose of my book
Nationalist and anti-colonialist ideologies, supported by growing literacy and political mobilization, have long since made imperial rule virtually impossible
All the same, Iraq’s parliamentary electoral law should be drawn up to take two important factors into account:
Until elections can be organized, it may be necessary to do what was done in Lebanon just after the war: appoint members to an interim Iraqi parliament
This would reinforce the need for inter-communal cooperation and minimize the risk of a return to any form of communal domination or dictatorship
It can choose to lead the Middle East into vibrant multi-sectarian democracy or slump back into corrupt local politics under foreign tutelage
BEIRUT – Hezbollah’s armed insurrection in May, which overran Beirut and other parts of Lebanon, has dealt a further blow to hopes of true state sovereignty in the country, strengthening Hezbollah and weakening the Western-backed government
Lebanon’s growth rate, which has averaged 3.7% over the last 10 years, has been, according to the Fund, “lower and more volatile than (averaged) in the MENA [Middle East-North Africa] region.”
What is certain is that, in making its decision, the Fed will not consider its policy’s spillover effects on the rest of the world, leaving affected countries’ policymakers and central bankers to deal with the fallout
When Charles de Gaulle revived the French Republic after World War II, he ignored the history of Vichy France and Nazi collaboration by pretending that all French citizens had been good republican patriots
Given that the combined equity capital stock of all US financial institutions is roughly $1.2 trillion dollars, this is a breathtaking sum
The timely reporting of non-realized capital gains and losses makes the shares of the company that holds them volatile, sending shock waves through the financial system
But that involves structural change in those economies as well, and thus will take time
The new transition process must emphasize consensus, with “no victor, no vanquished” serving as a guiding principle
The revision of the constitution must include public debate, and the resulting text must gain the support of a supermajority in a popular referendum
The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: "Do not try this at home."
Confusion about what cure to prescribe is caused in part by the fact that different medicines are suited for different problems, whereas much of the policy debate fails to distinguish among them adequately

Other armed Islamist formations, including Salafi groups, accepted integration into Libya’s new state institutions, such as the Supreme Security Committee (interior ministry) and the Libyan Shield Force (defense ministry)

When I visited Tripoli in March 2010 for a “national reconciliation” conference, the conflicting statements given by Saif al-Islam and security officials surprised me
As the world slowly moves from elation to sober realism, it is important to maintain a balanced view of what’s happening and avoid the dual risks of underestimating the truly revolutionary nature of what took place and overestimating the ability of Obama’s team to find miracle solutions
The “color wall” has fallen nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Wall that divided Germany and Europe
Within member governments, relations with the WTO are usually the responsibility of the trade or foreign ministry, while multilateral financial institutions, including the regional development banks, are generally the responsibility of the finance ministry

This last sentiment is posing a serious threat to Belgium’s survival
In 1999, the year before Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president, Russia’s GDP was a paltry $200 billion
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank, for example, is on a buying spree, aggravating the quality of Russian banking
Not surprisingly, all corruption indicators have been rising since Putin took over from Yeltsin, whereas they are falling in most post-communist countries

The Policy Position expressed the ECB Governing Council's stance on membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), a key precondition for future eurozone entry
After all, the Chinese economy can no longer rely on external demand and exports to sustain its remarkable growth, and Chinese consumers, who are still poor on average, deserve a break and should be encouraged to spend rather than save
Before it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, China had a wider range of policy instruments for achieving this end
Europe-wide regulation of banks encroaches on national sovereignty less than European control over fiscal policy. And European control over banks is less amenable to political abuse than national control
True, private capital flows have surged in the wake of global liberalization and these countries’ privatization schemes

Within a period of just a few weeks, the European Court of Justice (to which private parties can appeal decisions made by the Commission) voided three of Monti's decisions rejecting proposed corporate mergers
Start with the substance. The Court's verdicts leave the impression that competition policy in Europe is overly zealous
The Tetra Laval-Sidel case is particularly interesting because it shows the extent to Monti's team tends to second-guess private companies

As the war drags on, positive results are nowhere to be seen, while violence in the country is escalating
The National Police Force that Mexico’s last three presidents – Ernesto Zedillo, Vicente Fox and Calderón – have tried to build is still far from ready to replace the Army in drug-enforcement tasks
Some Mexicans congratulate President Fox for not caving in to US pressure to cast a vote in the Security Council for war, while others argue that he should
Mexico should use its current position in the Security Council to send a message: the country has matured and its foreign policy has matured with it
If Mexico votes against a US-sponsored resolution pushing for the use of force in Iraq in the next several days, the US shouldn't interpret the decision as a knee-jerk nationalistic response, but rather as a reflection of Mexico's interests

Milosevic and Hussein: Trial by Farce
Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials
Perisic's motives are many: a desire to take revenge on his former colleagues, or to destabilize Kostunica and/or to secure a promise that he will not be indicted by the Hague Tribunal
If this last is true, it will help confirm Serb suspicions that the Hague process stinks of politics
None of this helps Milosevic and his Socialist Party in opinion polls
President Kostunica also accepts the need to cooperate with the Hague but is more concerned to protect the country's sovereignty and preserve a semblance of national dignity
Even heads of state have not escaped these bodies

By comparison, about $100 billion a year is currently being spent on overseas aid
Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy notes that Morsi’s previous role in the Muslim Brotherhood’s Guidance Council sheds some light on the motives behind his current behavior
Outside the Middle East, the United States has scaled back its relations with Egypt since the government’s weak response to the attack on the US embassy in September, which signaled a rapid deterioration in bilateral relations
Morsi’s “Constitutional Declaration” was a decisive – though undemocratic, polarizing, and thus politically costly – step to break the impasse
So why isn’t more being done to ensure that young people acquire the skills they need?
And about a quarter of 16-19-year-olds in the labor force are unemployed
Billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, a proponent of reform, has been accused of hypocrisy because of his large financial contributions in connection with the upcoming presidential election
He relies on donors he calls "Pioneers," who collect $100,000 apiece in campaign contributions in increments that fall within the legal limit of $2,000 that any individual can give, and on those he calls "Rangers," who collect at least $200,000

Populist demagogues blame political, cultural, and commercial elites for the anxieties of the modern world
The stakes could be even higher in Mexico
But it also depends on the ability and willingness of government to provide a bridging function for the deficiency in aggregate demand, and to pursue reforms and investments that boost long-term growth prospects

If the assumption or the model is wrong, so is the estimate
Growth will not be restored easily or quickly
Instead of providing resolute leadership in the global financial and economic crisis, the European Union’s largest economy is withdrawing into its shell
The public trial of Mubarak shows what united demands can achieve

The original plan – like with so many of these programs – was based on a notion of parity: Israeli and Palestinian production teams would work together
Some unifying characters – such as an Arab- Israeli girl who explains each “side” to the other – would create a measure of continuity

A primary consequence of this “de-securitization” of Turkish foreign policy has been an altered balance of power between the country’s military and civilian establishments
Turkish officials say that they would not oppose any program that would strengthen NATO’s security
Ultimately, though, Turkey’s leaders have no intention of undermining NATO’s cohesiveness and effectiveness
For those of us who were engaged in the Kosovo crisis, the Libya intervention seems like déjà vu
The latter will not ensure the success of the former
The other was that all NATO member states are free to blackmail their partners into supporting their own narrow goals
Even if some Nato members want to distance themselves from this strategy, the Bush Administration unambiguously supports Nato’s role as a stability network
If the Prague summit will not showcase any grand new initiative, it is simply because we already launched a new NATO-Russia relationship last May at our special summit in Rome

Fully aware of the bitter legacy of Palestinian disinheritance following the 1948 war, Dayan refused to blame the murderers
The only question that Obama should ask Netanyahu is, When will Israel quit the occupied Palestinian territories?
On the other hand, the freely elected Palestinian leadership faces international boycott until it accepts a solution that the Netanyahu government rejects
The focus of Pope Benedict XVI’s visit to the Middle East was Jerusalem’s importance to Christians, Muslims, and Jews, so that attempts to Judaize the Holy City must stop immediately
His relentless disquisitions on Israel’s strategic environment, security requirements, red lines, and Jewish history are offset only by conciliatory talk about reopening negotiations, which are immediately reject by the Palestinians, who, like him, fear showing weakness

Today, many people now long for that period, which they see as less driven by material values
The cause of the East European financial crisis was a standard credit boom-and-bust cycle

Already, some village leaders are elected; this may slowly spread to regional officials, and then upward to the central government
Clearly, we need to get a better handle on what is driving these capital inflows
The loss in profits from poor countries is small relative to gray_market re-importation risks, but the cost for poor countries is high
This may be the right response if the inflows and upward pressure on the exchange rate are driven by fundamental factors (a current-account surplus, an undervalued currency, a large and persistent growth differential)
When justified by economic fundamentals, the exchange rate should be allowed to rise gradually
The government, she hints, will correct similar flaws
This would allow the European Banking Authority to treat these various T-bills as the equivalent of cash, because they could be sold to the ECB at any time

The truth about her disappearance will, undoubtedly, remain murky for some time
Yet Kim Kyong-hui’s ruling style is quite different from that of her late brother
Indeed, the regime’s efforts to hide, yet again, a severe food shortage demonstrate that its core values have not changed in the least
If the euro is to be preserved, and if stagnation is to be avoided, five policy measures could be attempted:

Nearly a half-century later, the world embarked on a better course with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1993. It is not susceptible to the charge of victor's justice, because the entire world is represented by its judgments

The elections earlier this year, which many at first assumed were a sham, now appear to have produced changes to which Asia’s countries will need to collectively and individually respond
Obama’s claim about record droughts similarly fails even on a cursory level – the United States has in all academic estimates been getting wetter over the century (with the 1930’s “dust bowl” setting the drought high point)
The argument to India was essentially this: You need us to realize your ambition to become a major world power, and we share a concern over China’s rise and Islamist terrorism, so let’s work together
It is hard to believe that Netanyahu, of all Israeli prime ministers, would be the one to accept idly Iran’s entry into the nuclear club
They must find their own way to freedom
The right has started to regroup, and Obama will surely point to this virtuous cycle as one in which the US has played a positive role, and can continue to do so
Obama’s caution is reasonable
India must ask Obama hard questions about how security is to be assured, but, before doing so, it needs to ask the same questions of itself
Two great peoples and countries, although now locked in a “strategic alliance,” may occasionally fall out of step with one another, as India and the US have – for example, over global climate negotiations
Perhaps our best hope for stability and peace lies in China’s refusal to be provoked
He campaigned on the theme that he is different from other politicians and will deliver real change
The structure of the Security Council is 60 years old. It still gives the victors of the Second World War permanent membership of the Council, and a veto over its decisions
US aid also must be better targeted toward helping those living in extreme poverty
Obama’s Hardest Choices Lie Ahead
For many in Europe, it was easier to live against Bush than to make sacrifices with Obama
But the Iranians are the subtlest negotiators to be found anywhere, and will make certain that their nuclear program outpaces the negotiations
Kurdistan has embarked on a path toward increased autonomy, while the Sunnis are increasingly marginalized by a sectarian and authoritarian Shia-dominated central government
There can no longer be any doubt that the occupation of Iraq was a huge strategic defeat for the US, because it ultimately served only to strengthen Iran
Contrary to what one might think, he does not have a real strategic vision of the world – a shortcoming reflected in his quick capitulation in the face of opposition to his proposals
Simpson never met an unfunded tax cut proposed by a Republican president that he would vote against, and he never met a balanced deficit-reduction program proposed by a Democratic president that he would support
Contrast that with the 30% of Americans who approve of his handling of the economy, or the scant 26% who back his approach to the federal budget deficit
Europeans have long been hospitable to black American stars
Rather than catalyzing constructive policy coordination, it has inadvertently encouraged complacency
And it would force multilateral organizations to reform if they wish to retain even the limited relevance that they have now
“What do you mean by ‘good?’” he will ask. “And good for whom?”&#160;
The United Kingdom has been reluctant to join the hydraulic-fracturing (or fracking) revolution
With world energy prices at record highs, it makes sense for oil economies to run surpluses, thereby saving for when oil supplies eventually peter out
The global oil market has become a large sea that generates its own storms, which guarantee that the sea will continue to grow
Second, there is the relationship between oil prices and the need for income diversification in the oil-producing countries
Properly used, an oil fund can contribute to this aim, but it should do so indirectly, by promoting domestic financial stability
But, then, why is America's birth rate higher than in many countries in Europe that have much larger public support for childbearing mothers?
Many became dependent on food aid, while some acted on the conviction that eradicating hunger is merely a matter of fostering GDP growth
Unlike the top-down, technical solutions that policymakers have usually favored, a solution based on the concept of food as an entitlement, not a privilege, would involve – and empower – multiple actors
In Mexico – where the right to food was constitutionally recognized in 2011 – an inter-ministerial commission includes 19 government departments and institutions
Across the región, Chávez’s influence was strong
His backing was a decisive influence in the election of Bolivia’s President Evo Morales in 2006, and the following year he supported Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador, though his impact on their victories is hotly debated
Today, with Venezuela’s economy mired in high inflation and overly dependent on oil, Chávez is fading as a regional model and guide
Hosting the Olympics boosts performance before the hosted Games, and has effects that outlast them

The dream of One Europe was put off for almost two generations
One Europe in the service of freedom, justice and security
But this latest dispute is characteristic of a remarkable flurry of anti-Japanese activity in China since 2003
Optimists counter that China and Japan can cooperate, acting as the “dual engines” of Asian development
All are playing a game that some must lose
Where Japan really falls short is in English - the global language, and thus the main purveyor of global ideas
The LRA, which first emerged in northern Uganda in the late 1980’s, is blamed for at least 30,000 deaths and the displacement of two million people
Civilians may not be targeted; the principle of proportionality requires the avoidance of excessive force in pursuing a legitimate military objective; and prisoners must be treated humanely
Significantly, as the CIA closed in on bin Laden, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, for the first time publicly linked the Pakistani military with some of the militants attacking US forces in Afghanistan
In 2008, we started at 365% – and this calculation leaves out the pervasive use of derivatives, which was absent in the 1930’s
Overall, the international financial authorities have handled this crisis the same way as they handled previous ones: they bailed out failing institutions and applied monetary and fiscal stimulus
Where energy is concerned, everything seemed simple before the Iraq War
First, we should recognize that even as oil becomes scarce, other fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and unconventional sources such as shale and tar sands, will remain plentiful for centuries
Old people are so frightened of being killed by homicidal doctors that they wear bracelets that read: “Do not euthanize me.”
The world financial system again stood at the edge of a precipice
Sixty years ago, a global crisis such as the one we are witnessing today would have had the potential to unleash another world war
The changes in the planet’s energy budget caused by solar variations are at least ten times smaller in comparison
With swift and decisive action, we can still limit global warming to a total of 2º Celsius or a bit less

The army has always been the strongest bulwark in assuring that Pakistan does not go the way of Iran
The deep security crisis in Pakistan is mirrored across the border in Afghanistan, which offers a model of what not to do
Moreover, Abbas has not given up his positions as head of the PLO and leader of its biggest faction, Fatah, which remains in control in the West Bank
Whoever emerges on top will have to present an effective strategy to end four decades of military occupation and bring about a truly independent state that a majority of Palestinians can embrace
The Palestinian Arab defeat in this endeavor, and the resulting refugee problem, is a defining moment for Palestinians
By contrast, the besieged Jewish community, under David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish self-defense force (the Hagannah) was able to mobilize, through its democratic institutions and with only marginal dissent, the resources needed for a successful military campaign
Israel is divided on how to deal with Hamas, which will also complicate the start of peace talks
Mahmoud Abbas, the chairman of the PLO and President of the Palestinian Authority, who has vowed not to run for re-election, has chosen to&#160;take the path of UN recognition&#160;rather than continue&#160;with the charade of useless – indeed, harmful – direct talks
Palestinians’ desire to obtain a UN vote on statehood (in whatever form) does not mean that they cannot have direct negotiations with Israel
Facing economic stagnation and what Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei calls “the anarchy of weapons,” a succession struggle is the last thing Palestinians need
Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen) represents the Old Guard of Palestinian politics
But the Young Guard – those who led the first Intifada (1987-1993), as well as those making their names in the current Intifada – want a share of power
The very structure of society has come to be shaky
Indeed, international institutions have spearheaded breakthroughs in a wide range of areas, including health, finance, economics, human rights, and peacekeeping
But such institutions are largely perceived as inaccessible, inefficient, and opaque, leading national governments to neglect them
But how can the benefits of a global patent system that provides incentives for innovation and new discoveries be combined with an assurance that poor people gain access to the medical care that they desperately need?
Merchandise needn’t pass through the capital, as it does in most Latin American and Caribbean countries, with the associated cost increases
More ominously, crime is on the rise and a breakdown in state-controlled health care is fueling the spread of various types of infectious disease
The question then becomes, who helped Kim build these facilities?
Nuclear cooperation between North Korea and Iran is no doubt assisting both countries to flaunt international norms – and now it appears that Burma has joined this axis of illicit nuclear proliferation
For the US, sympathy for Arab publics yearning for freedom cannot exclude compassion for Palestinians dreaming of lives of dignity, which for them includes ending the occupation
Too many political leaders, including President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the leaders of radical groups in the Middle East, prefer military solutions to peaceful compromise
Aside from the Annapolis talks, which seem to be going nowhere because of the parties’ irreconcilable differences over the core issues, all the other peace efforts are more tactical than strategic
In none of them do the conditions yet exist for an immediate leap from war to peace, nor do the parties themselves expect that to happen
Indeed, the decades following it have been rife with bloody conflicts in which entire population groups have been murdered
The Palestinian leadership knows that if Iran ever launches a nuclear attack against Israel, their people would suffer terribly as well
To his credit, Clinton and his staff decided, despite the violence, to make one last attempt in Taba, Egypt late in his presidency
President Barack Obama has raised hopes for a new strategy, but so far the forces of continuity in US policy are dominating the forces of change
Rather, it will have to be developed proactively, with a sense of urgency and in close partnership with the affected countries and the communities within them
For China, problems are judged according to the country’s own history and from the standpoint of domestic policy – all the more so the closer the problem is to its borders
Though such support remains a possibility, it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf
Quaid-e-Azam University has become a brothel
He will have time to do so, because no new proposal is likely to be launched in a US presidential election year
But he has long-term responsibilities - both to Mexicans in Mexico and to Mexicans in the US - that go beyond obtaining a short-term political victory
Bush's proposal is full of holes, and Fox should figure out how to fill them
WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA – After decades of bad news, at least three major trends are turning Africa’s way: agricultural policies, rural demography, and farm productivity all promise improved opportunities for farm families across the continent
Moreover, post-independence improvements in child survival triggered a rise in child dependency rates, which also reached historically unprecedented levels in the 1970’s and 1980’s
But, looking forward, as these headwinds fade, faster growth and poverty alleviation are becoming easier to achieve
But, while a runaway climate remains a risk, runaway politics are already a fact
But, given the political evolution of Ukraine, not to mention Belarus, Poland can no longer dream of an Eastern future
Poland is benefiting from economic growth and prosperity in Germany, its immediate western neighbor and closest ally
But, 11 years after my conversation with Geremek, communism collapsed in Poland, and in 2004 the country’s “return” to Europe was complete
Forced secularization from above--relatively successful in the Soviet Union--failed abjectly
It is to be a democracy steered from above, with only a limited division of power and a streak of authoritarianism, guided by a mixture conservatism, populism, and nationalism
President Lech Kaczynski’s approval ratings, are dramatically lower than those of his predecessor, the SLD’s Aleksander Kwasniewski

In fact, some AKP heavyweights, including Erdoğan’s longtime associate, President Abdullah Gül, believe that he badly mismanaged the recent protests
Political Islam has reached a critical juncture on the road toward democratic legitimacy
When a country's newly discovered natural resource abundance leads to windfall wealth, investment in the rest of its economy shifts away from the tradeables sector (mainly manufactured exports) and into the nontradeables sector (mainly consumer goods and services)
There is only one main way that the necessary productivity and outcome gains can be achieved: excess demand in the public sector must be shifted elsewhere
These countries, like Norway, were winners in the natural resource lottery. But that is no guarantee that they will remain rich after the payments stop. 
In Afghanistan, that so-called war has essentially been based on eradication campaigns and alternative livelihood projects, which have achieved only scant results
Governments, international organizations and individuals that participate in the London conference must not dismiss the call made by the European Parliament, for it offers a far more workable strategy to promote Afghanistan’s future than the current counter-narcotics policies permit
In contrast to men like Funes, Ortega, Mujica, and Chávez, whose careers began in guerrilla movements or failed coups, Mockus’s past is irreproachable
Conversely, legislative elections in March gave the Mockus-Fajardo ticket only minimal representation in the two chambers of Congress, implying that any government that they form would need all the legislative allies that it can find in order to enact its agenda
Aside from the working poor, an additional 215 million workers worldwide slipped below the poverty line in 2008-2009, owing to the Great Recession

Last year The Economist claimed that “Growth really does help the poor: in fact it raises their incomes by about as much as it raises the incomes of everybody else.”
For the richest 10% of people in India the income gain from aggregate economic growth tends to be about four times higher than the gain to the poorest 20%; in Brazil it tends to be almost 20 times higher
In other words, in countries where the level of income inequality is high, inequality is reduced less by growth than in countries where inequality is relatively low
At a recent conference, US government representatives were unimpressed by European pleas to do something about the deficits – and the falling dollar that has resulted from them
But the trend will not be stopped
There is no escape from balancing costs and benefits
But the preventive measure is extremely costly, and it might have an effect opposite to our intention
Because the very premise of the current deal and the expectations it sets out are wrong
According to the World Health Organization, as many as half a million people die each year from influenza
In the meantime, we should intensify the fight against an older nemesis, influenza, both for its own sake and as a way to prepare for the return of SARS. 
Unless leading actors have ownership of local solutions, peace will never be sustainable
Moreover, having a son in the military is a significant blow to a family’s income – about 15% according to Lokshin and Yemtsov
A successful transition would give real opportunities to a generation of unemployed young people, thus enabling them to take responsibility for their futures – and the future of the region
Since governments already pay the cost of much drug research directly or indirectly, through prescription benefits, they could finance the prize fund, which would award the biggest prizes for developers of treatments or preventions for costly diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people
So, the good news of the last decade is just a glimmer of hope
As well as working at a grass roots level, policies on trade and aid should be used to encourage governments to reform and enlarge the space for legitimate political action
Meanwhile, NATO can provide the peacekeeping capabilities needed to help rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq
Finally, we must reorganize ourselves to sustain such a course

At Battery Park, on Manhattan’s south end, the surge height reached 4.2 meters, flooding homes and businesses and plunging millions into darkness
This could include designing the ground levels of seaside buildings to permit storm-induced surges to pass through without flooding the lower floors, thus minimizing potential damage to offices and homes

In the case of Zimbabwe, it is extremely difficult to obtain such information
While America loses, Europe loses, many in the developing world lose, and much more is at stake
But the US believes that even this is not enough: it will interpret these rules in ways which suit its political interests, bending and breaking them at will, challenging those who do not like it to do something about it
Think of the lessons that poor developing countries learn
Orwellian use of terms like “fair trade” masks the fact that this is nothing but an insidious form of protectionism that seeks to reduce import competition

(Ironically, the upcoming election will de facto serve as the referendum that Papandreou suggested in October 2011.)
The impression Putin's presidency creates is of autocracy punctuated by elections
So Medvedev will become the next president, and will hold that office for at least one full term
For the lesson of the years of communist misrule is this: no one man or party can know enough to manage a modern economy
By contrast, successful democracies believe that nobody is irreplaceable
With the USSR’s demise, communist ideology, which Muslims believe contradicts their faith, ended too
Nowadays, however, the establishment is named after a popular Soviet borscht-western (or “eastern”) filmed in 1969 and set in Central Asia during the 1919 Civil War
Targets depicting serial killers and drug dealers have mottos like “Save a woman” or “Save a boy” on them
Sometimes he killed an official who was not on good terms with the police. At other times, the police simply did not want to betray their precious agent
To divide a people in order to conquer them is an immoral strategy that has endured throughout recorded history
Indeed, Putin openly claims this part of Ukraine as a Russian “internal matter.”
Any plans to “defend” Yanukovich and the eastern part of Ukraine by military force must be confronted
It is all the more important that we remember this today, because these threats are not becoming fewer, but are only transforming and changing their appearance
But weakened, as it no doubt is, Putin's Russia still regards itself as a great power
Foreign investment is still viewed as desirable, but no one attaches primary importance to attracting it anymore
Overly close contacts with NATO (let alone membership) would deprive Russia of strategic independence
Will Russia, whose political legacy is not British but Soviet, be another?
In 2007, Putin addressed the Olympic Committee (in English), and persuasively argued that the Games will “play a major role in Russia’s future
One joke nicely encapsulates the hubris that Putin and his Kremlin allies felt: Putin and Medvedev discuss their newly found invincibility
But Yeltsin could never get over Russia's lost superpower status; his periodic growls to assert Russia's wounded pride ultimately made him seem unreliable
In the summer of 2002, the North Korean leader visited Russia to learn about "non-intrusive"--that is, not entirely Western--capitalism, while riding in an armored train on the Trans-Siberian railway
Kim seemed to reason that, while Russia was no longer Soviet, it retained enough socialist overtones to work with his country
This will allow President Bush to avoid seeming to surrender to the threat of nuclear blackmail
Indifferent to the poor, Russia’s government is actively supporting its fallen oligarchs, especially those who are close to the Kremlin
There is enough baby food in the shops. But now there are no hopes for freedom
During the 15 years that it has broadcast from Qatar, Al Jazeera has served as far more than a traditional television station
It hosts Israeli spokespersons and embraces state-of-the-art broadcasting techniques
Quantitative Easing and America’s Economic Rebound
Until the fourth quarter of last year, the US economic recovery that began in the summer of 2009 was decidedly anemic
None of this appears to augur well for 2011

It was about standing up to the Zionist enemy, the high-tech crusader whose military superiority can be defeated only by stubborn resistance
The board would be allowed to base its choices on raters’ past performance
A recent transatlantic survey by the German Marshall Fund found that, while majorities in all countries were worried about illegal immigration, anxiety about legal immigration was low – with only 26% of European&#160;respondents expressing concern, and just 18% doing so in the United States
The reality, of course, is that many countries, especially OECD members, will decide that they need more immigrants as their own populations age and shrink
A basic principle of toxicology is that the dose makes the poison
LONDON – After the 1997-1998 financial crisis, policymakers in Asia’s major emerging markets – South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and even Indonesia – vowed “never again” to be humiliated by international capital markets
There are leaders in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) who are also willing to take part
Unfortunately, the Georgian crisis demonstrated that Russia’s dialogue with NATO was less substantial than it should have been
The world will have to get used to the fact that Russia is no longer a feeble country
A real, working NATO-Russia relationship could provide the Alliance with solutions to problems that it cannot tackle on its own
But, with the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union, Asia receded from American interest
American companies export more than $300 billion in goods and services to countries in the region each year
We must also redefine common threats, while strengthening the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s mechanisms for preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts
The interdependence of all states – large or small, weak or powerful, democratic or authoritarian – has become the organizing principle of today’s international security system
But sanctions are the wrong approach, for international marginalization hurts ordinary citizens far more than it hurts dictatorial regimes
International organizations have cut back or eliminated their work in the country, and much bilateral foreign aid has been eliminated, too
Smart sanctions include denial of international travel privileges to despots and their families, and subjecting those despots to the risk of international prosecution

The international community should stop pushing for a backroom “compromise” that ignores the popular will
Moreover, the shift from recovery efforts to fiscal consolidation and, more recently, to current-account rebalancing, has undermined the initial G-20-led coordinated recovery efforts
Critics suggest that QE2 is really intended only to create inflationary expectations and thus encourage acquisition of more risky assets by reducing rates on Treasury bills with longer-term maturities (5-7 years and 7-10 years)
Meanwhile, agreeing on Basel 3 banking standards in just two years is commendable, especially as Basel 2 took a decade to negotiate
As Mahatma Gandhi put it, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.”

So, if the deficit being measured is one of houses rather than one of habitats, the solutions often do not solve the real problem
Did they want to strengthen international law barring the use of chemical weapons, or to send Iran a signal about their determination to enforce “red lines”?
To succeed, Western leaders must reframe their approach to the Syrian endgame, rejecting the assumptions that have shaped their policies since the beginning of the crisis
The alternative – an attempt at negotiation between Syria’s government and an increasingly fragmented opposition – would serve only to prolong the war and raise the death toll
So what should Latin American economies do?
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics, but the West either doesn’t recognize the changes or is hostile to them
This gap is bound to affect negatively the processes of nuclear disarmament that are now being envisaged, for these states’ flirtation with nuclear weapons is not just a quest for prestige or status; it is an attempt to counter the conventional superiority of hostile neighbors – or, as with Iran and North Korea, of the US itself
Greece, moreover, has another huge problem: its current-account deficit is currently a whopping 13% of net national income, which means that €27 billion have to be financed annually by borrowing or selling Greek assets
With international investors no longer willing to finance this deficit, and even shying away from refinancing existing Greek debt, only three possibilities remain
The first is that the European Union provides the necessary funds on a permanent basis, creating a “European Transfer Union” to the benefit of the deficit countries, including Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy
This lack of sound models meant that economic policymakers and central bankers received no warning of what was to come
There are undoubtedly “natural” barriers, such as language and national mentalities, which cannot be overcome swiftly. But there are also big “man-made” barriers, particularly those created by different national legislation in the fields of investor and consumer protection

Their eagerness for war had several causes
The ricochet effects of the Iraq War have combined to yield a mounting threat to stability and security
"There is nothing more inconspicuous than a monument," said the Austrian writer Robert Musil a hundred years ago
Sometimes, monuments are in absentia, like professors on sabbatical
The work of mourning, to use Freud's formula, is continuous
The museum on Solovki Island fills just a few rooms inside the functioning monastery
Designed as a local symbol of mourning, these poles, with their sharply angled roofs, remind viewers either of a peasant cross or a human figure with hands raised in prayer
But Russian memory is also subject to Western-style postmodernist mockery
His advice is essentially to practice a form of digital abstinence

New difficulties in the US and China, the world’s two largest economies, would have a negative impact on global investor confidence, hurting US employment even more
But multilateralism is much easier to advocate than to design and implement
Although the central government may be committed to reforms, implementation at the local level can be very uneven, owing to parochial and vested interests
For example, since 2008, when the central authorities tried to boost growth to combat the global crisis, local governments expanded their investment capacity through shadow-banking vehicles that sought to circumvent restraints on bank credit
While there is no shortage of challenges facing Libya’s new government, disbanding the militias must be at the top of its agenda

The possibility that non-state actors could acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction poses an especially grave new threat
Five hundred years ago, the Atlantic rainforest stretched nearly the entirety of Brazil’s 8,500-kilometer coastline; today, less than 7% remains

Recognition of this fundamental problem was the reason why the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were created in the 1960’s
As Fred Bergsten has reminded us, the mechanism is already available in the form of the “substitution account” that was negotiated in the IMF in 1980
In these times, difficult and unpredictable but full of hope, the world needs Turkey and the EU to work together
This implies more complex contracts that go beyond promoting markets, GDP growth, and employment to ensure inclusive, equitable, and high-quality government-services delivery

To promote the sale of household electrical appliances in rural areas, the government has begun providing a 13% price subsidy, not only benefiting rural consumption, but also boosting the growth of major industrial enterprises
But both the diagnosis and the remedy are incorrect
It may also be constructive to take advantage of transitional provisions linked to Turkey’s EU accession
And, at the most recent EU summit, leaders agreed to commit at least 20% of their entire common budget to climate-related spending
The political consequences of the US economy’s renewed strength will reverberate worldwide
This recognition has already dampened US policymakers’ support for the Arab Spring uprisings: witness Obama’s hesitation to intervene in Libya and his unwillingness, at least so far, to involve America directly in Syria’s bloody civil war
This mixed record calls into question the efficacy of conventional poverty-reduction policies, often identified with the Washington Consensus, which transformed the discourse on poverty in the 1980’s
According to the World Bank’s much cited “dollar-a-day” international poverty line, which was revised in 2008 to $1.25 a day in 2005 prices, there are still 1.4 billion people living in poverty, down from 1.9 billion in 1981
Similarly, America’s preventive war against an Iraq that ignored the UN and was thought to possess weapons of mass destruction showed that sovereignty no longer provides absolute protection
CAMBRIDGE – Modern macroeconomics often seems to treat rapid and stable economic growth as the be-all and end-all of policy
Now suppose that we lived in a much faster-growing economy, with per capita income rising at 2% annually
Because banks would need to accept higher risk, a secondary market for mortgages is necessary

Citizenship tests are an integral part of this program; and, in the eyes of critics, they resemble “loyalty oaths” and other intolerant measures traditionally associated with the anti-communist witch-hunts of McCarthyism in 1950’s America
Some collapse and, unable to reach food or water, soon die, their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole
Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes
There are many reasons for this outcome, but at least some of the blame lies with the European Union
The EU cannot alter the international coalition’s strategy alone
In exchange, the US should accept a strategic shift from combat operations to human security
This fatalistic vision is tragic and could become a self-fulfilling nightmare
First, enlargement will take the EU right up to the frontier of Russia and the former Soviet Union; if Turkey joins, the EU will extend to the heart of the Middle East as well
Israel’s European Peace?
In Egypt, the tense, polarized environment following the military’s overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi has created the real possibility of civil conflict
Yet the Palestinian Authority demanded their release, Israel’s government obliged, and the US supported the transaction
Finally, the enlargements of the 1980’s, when Greece and then Spain and Portugal joined the then European Community, were not very disruptive
But creating that architecture is a daunting task, which has taken Europe decades and is still ongoing
Confronted after 1906 with a more assertive Russia, Austria-Hungary resorted to increasing reliance on Germany, thereby relinquishing the empire’s special status as a geopolitical stabilizer
This allowed many European Union countries to approach the crisis with room for maneuver
For starters, there are more bailouts to come, with Portugal at the top of the list
Have the Europeans decided that sovereign default is easier, or are they just dreaming that it won’t happen?
The euro was launched in January 1999 for a complex set of economic, financial, political, and historical reasons
Suppose that southern Europe is hit much harder by today’s recession than northern Europe.  An economy has two potential ways to adapt to and mitigate its downturn
For starters, politics lags behind economics, which in turn lags behind market developments
This might stimulate real growth through several channels: by reducing lending rates, by raising the nominal value of public and private assets, and by weakening the euro against the dollar and other currencies
But sometimes shock waves are needed to break the ice and start the water flowing again
Unemployment rates would converge, as would other important macroeconomic variables, such as unit labor costs, productivity, and fiscal deficits and government debt
If it keeps its interest rate too low for too long, countries like Germany and the Netherlands will protest
In other words, Greece qualified only by cheating
In their enthusiasm for creating a “single market,” European leaders did not recognize that governments provide an implicit subsidy to their banking systems
Moreover, Greek public workers should expect massive pay cuts, which, in Greece’s poisonous political climate is a sure route to dangerous levels of civil strife and violence
After tough negotiations, the government and its creditors would probably eventually slash Greece’s debt in half
She would be able to pursue a two- or three-year program, instead of her current four-week strategy
Somewhat faster demand growth in Germany and a lower external surplus would help not only Germany’s trade partners, but also German savers
The 10 new countries that will join next year--and even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membership--are all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe
Likewise, debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources, as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought, benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor
Rating agencies would consider this debt exchange a “credit event,” but only for a very short period – a matter of a few weeks
The eurozone should also pursue a policy – partially via looser monetary policy – that weakens the value of the euro significantly and restores the periphery’s competitiveness
But what we have seen since 2007 is an overshooting of the contraction in consumer demand and domestic investment
But the persistence of these difficulties sheds light on why the eurozone was established in the first place
The turbulence reinforces the lesson – fundamental to the rationale of establishing the euro – that ordinary people and businesses should not be exposed to exchange-rate risk
NEW YORK – Since World War II’s end, the global economy’s trade and financial openness has increased, thanks to institutions like the International Monetary Fund and successive rounds of liberalization, starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947
As emerging-market economies shift to higher value-added components in global supply chains, their physical, human, and institutional capital deepen
At this point, countries arrive at a crossroads
Indeed, we showed that aggressive conservation actions have reduced bird extinction rates over the last few decades to about 25 E/MSY – still very high, but down sharply from the 100 E/MSY projected were conservation actions not in place

The “extremists,” whom Bush expected to be defeated through economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and military action, have prevailed
I told each member of our negotiating team to decide for himself or herself whether to shake hands with the mass murderers
Karadzic’s capture is all the more important because Serbian authorities accomplished it
Indeed, protectionism can do nothing to reduce America's trade deficit and stanch domestic unemployment
So long as developing countries remain integrated into the global economy – and do not take measures to restrain the impact of international prices on domestic prices – domestic prices of rice and other grains are bound to rise markedly when international prices do
But, unless taken to an intolerable level, these measures by themselves cannot bring inflation down to the targeted levels
A policy that leaves owners of risky financial assets impoverished is a policy that shuts down dynamism in the real economy
Acknowledging that rating agencies were incompetent without doing anything to regulate them was inexcusable
For example, a recent law mandates punishment for anyone who spreads rumors that Gamal is to be the next president
But, while this seems more responsive than “no comment,” it says little about the course of current and future US government action
Kerosene saved the whales (which had been hunted almost to extinction to provide supposedly “renewable” whale oil for lighting)
Solar-electric power has gone from essentially zero to 0.04%
It needs no subsidies, and it produces 50 times more energy than all of China’s solar panels
When green renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels, they will take over the world
So the commentary on Gordon’s paper has been largely dissociated from the policy discussions addressing the ongoing Great Recession
We lived the better part of the subsequent decade with a misguided sense of extended prosperity and inflated a financial bubble
That 1.4% decline came during a decade in which the US population grew by about 9.8%
But a preliminary comparison between Europe’s largest economy, Germany, and the US suggests that the former is better equipped to hold its own in the age of globalization
Exasperated by Kim’s refusal to ease international tensions, Chinese officials have made clear their refusal to protect and subsidize North Korea’s elite if it continues to push the US toward confrontation
But a lump-sum charge to recover past costs will not change the financial sector’s incentives concerning excessive risk-taking
Regulation then must ensure that bankers don’t abuse their charter by taking excessive risks with their depositors’ money – which is precisely where regulators failed most notably in recent years, opening the way to the financial crisis
What would the G-8 leaders do, station troops in Africa to seize coffee beans and peanuts?
The notion of a single set of criteria to evaluate the governance of publicly traded firms worldwide is undoubtedly appealing
Individuals respond to the incentives created by the variety of early-retirement and retirement programs
It is all the more irrational in view of the rather modest effects early retirement plans have on unemployment in general, and on youth unemployment in particular. 
One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world’s richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs (such as America’s Social Security system) are outmoded
After all, in such a world, workers who set great value on a defined-benefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions
More generally, there is little evidence that countries with independent central banks grow faster, have higher wages, or generate higher incomes--indeed, that they perform better in any real sense--than those that do not
Viewed from the West, they were perceived as a tool to keep the government under control by enabling people to watch what it was doing
But let’s not fool ourselves by thinking that achieving it will restore citizens’ faith in their political institutions
Those advocating for harm reduction accept that drugs have always been a part of human history and aim to decrease the damage caused by their production and use
Sadly, when we meet again in ten years, this will no longer hold true
In response to the global recession of 2008, the United Kingdom embarked on an austerity program while the United States enacted an $800 billion fiscal stimulus
In fact, America’s bizarre new policy is likely to remain unique among airports in the industrialized countries, if not the entire world
Welcome to America’s current reality, in which threats are hyped so that a handful of insiders can make a killing
I am not suggesting that sexually degrading practices are a conscious part of the TSA’s new policy
Will an attack on such a symbol reinforce the prevalence of fear in an American society that was once defined by hope?
Can Western societies remain what they are, or at least should be – open, tolerant, and respectful of difference – while responding to demands for greater protection against the multifaceted threats, whether imagined or real, that we face?
To protect the Fed’s independence, which is a global public good of the highest importance, he should cut back the Fed’s authority to its core role
There would also be insistent calls for curtailing the Federal Reserve’s powers or limiting its independence from Congress
As a result, only the Fed’s interest-rate instrument, Stein and Tarullo argue, can get into all of the financial system’s cracks
The last arrow in their quiver is called quantitative easing (QE), and it is likely to be almost as ineffective in reviving the US economy as anything else the Fed has tried in recent years
Central banks are better at restraining markets’ irrational exuberance in a bubble – restricting the availability of credit or raising interest rates to rein in the economy – than at promoting investment in a recession
But feminism was always more of a response to women entering the labor force than its cause
Wherever women enter the labor force in large numbers, certain processes unfold
“Punjabi Taliban” militants from the fighting in Kashmir against India continue to shuttle between the Punjab heartland and the Northwest Territories, posing another serious challenge to government authority
The UN recently revised its population projections
Just thirty years ago, people like Stanford University's Paul Ehrlich were telling us that the Malthusian Angel of Death was at the door
An early assessment of the stimulus packages suggests that China’s program has worked well
Now the US needs to return to this important idea
Openly isolationist political forces, such as the Tea Party and libertarians like Ron Paul, will grow stronger
Why not remind US politicians of their global responsibilities?
This is for the best of reasons - fish that are caught when they are too small will produce a small yield
Indeed, there is evidence from many fisheries of earlier maturation; such changes take place fast enough to be detected over the decades
Radical new thinking is needed in fisheries management to overcome the ecological and evolutionary problems generated by current practice
Yet the current crisis, like others that preceded it, shows that monetary policy governs anticipations, not only of inflation but also of growth, whether central banks like it or not. 
Several surveys show that adults reporting childhood sexual abuse often say that there was a period of time when they “could not remember” their abuse
There was, moreover, strong resentment that political power lay in the hands of western-based politicians and generals who were blatantly insensitive to Bengali demands
At the same time, developing countries have continued to grapple with the persistence of mass poverty, endemic disease, malnutrition, environmental degradation, and gross income inequity, all of which have caused a degree of human suffering that far exceeds what has been caused by terrorist attacks
People in the industrialized countries are already an estimated 74 times richer per capita than those in the poorest countries
Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial production by 1900
As the world’s largest economy, the US has taken the lead in promoting policies that reduce barriers
While the euro has not caused France’s economic problems, its politicians’ commitment to the single currency represents an insurmountable barrier to solving them
Will the public grin and bear it, or demand a radical change of direction?
But the party never debated or theorized this choice, simply accepting former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin’s claim that the fiscal stability and financial modernization resulting from the decision was but a “parenthesis.”
The main opposition Socialist Party’s weak electoral prospects are also helping Sarkozy
How can civilian, democratic control of the army and police be secured?
The former communist world made those choices 20 years ago

The report is the result of a longstanding China-World Bank partnership
China must remain committed to resuscitating the stalled Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and support a global agreement on investment flows
As Mark Leonard, Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, has put it, “The conventional wisdom is that Europe’s hour has come and gone
The goal of a strong dollar at home has guided the Federal Reserve at least since Paul Volcker crushed inflation in the early 1980’s
The variety of machines currently under study is accessible at 
Some countries responded by doing nothing, but many, including industrialized countries like Japan and Switzerland, intervened heavily in currency markets
Even the World Bank, which usually takes the donors’ point of view, recently acknowledged that except for debt cancellation, “promises of scaled up aid have not been delivered.”
I don’t agree with that, but the cynicism that such a view reflects is alarming. It shows the nature of discussions at the highest reaches of the G-8
To salvage its credibility, the G-8 needs to make crystal clear ­– once again – that it will honor its commitment to increase aid to Africa by $25 billion per year by 2010
Small groups of Palestinians smash up the remains of Gaza’s bombed industrial infrastructure – the concrete blocks that litter the sandy landscape
The result is always a unique individual. 
By contrast, the OMT program is unconstrained
Instead, today’s left looks at growth, fiscal discipline and competitiveness with pragmatism, and not as ideological red flags
In any case, the Stability Pact's death means that a new fiscal framework is needed
But, as this year’s World Nuclear Industry Status Report highlights, recent trends paint a very different picture
As a result of such delays, only three new units began operating last year – half the number of reactors that were shut down
After all, no economy can raise living standards forever through innovations that make production of existing goods more efficient
Following the Internet boom of the late 1990's, job creation slowed, while efficiency improvements continued to reduce the labor required by the "old" goods and services
These new mass markets sustained a steady increase in average incomes and total employment
Initially, the group should only exert peer pressure on its members to comply with international responsibilities
That decline was primarily the result of more unfavorable appraisals of the current economic situation, but also reflected another downward revision of expectations for the next six months. Today, the index is at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2001
The real economy remains under enormous pressure in several countries, as economies contract and unemployment remains alarmingly high
I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year

Many uninsured get free care in emergency rooms of public and private hospitals and receive free care for chronic conditions in those same institutions
Mortgage interest rates fell below 5% in March and April, but have risen significantly since then
In short, we will have to wait for the data on house prices in June and July to know whether there has been a permanent turnaround
After his speech at the United Nations appealing for a “red line” on the Iranian nuclear program in the spring or summer of 2013, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called an early general election, which could potentially give him a strong mandate for action against Iran
After nearly a decade of draining military engagement, the US combat mission in Iraq concluded in 2010, and the combat mission in Afghanistan is set to end in 2014
While the Mental Health First Aid course’s rapid expansion has helped to improve the situation in many communities, there is much left to do
In the last three years, 11% of Australia’s population has completed such a course, partly owing to requirements that people in certain positions, such as child-care workers, have a first-aid certificate
Instead, an imperfect answer produced heightened vulnerability
Ethnically homogeneous Japan is an example of how three different religions – Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism – can coexist peacefully and, in many cases, intermingle
While the decline in fertility is global, its speed varies across countries
All developing countries should monitor these demographic developments closely, even if they have yet to experience population aging themselves
Last month, at Biola University, a Christian college in southern California, I debated the existence of God with the conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza

But the only European biomedical research that has used great apes recently is the Biomedical Primate Research Centre at Rijswijk, in the Netherlands
But, as individual taxpayers, we are helpless, because we do not control outcomes, owing to the concerted efforts of lobbyists, or, worse, economic policymakers
The good news is that most governments do see the need to implement significant new regulation on financial firms
Investors and policymakers are often altogether ignorant of the myriad historical experiences with financial crises
That sentiment probably held back consumption and investment far more than any opinions about changes in the next six months
Moreover, important developments that occurred between the 1929 stock-market crisis and the 1937 fiscal retrenchment – especially America’s turn to protectionism in 1930 and the monetary turmoil of subsequent years – have no analog today
If that sounds familiar, its is because the Chinese Communist Party never forgets its history – and is determined to prevent history from repeating itself
Software prevents users from posting politically sensitive words, and provocative content that gets past the automated controls is frequently removed
The Chinese public has grown expert over the years at finding plenty of things to do and talk about while avoiding politically dangerous issues
Unfortunately, faced with a choice between protecting the long-term interests and human rights of their customers and complying with laws implemented by unelected power-holders, technology firms like Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google seem to have embraced the Ah Q spirit
This year’s heavy monsoon rains have wrought havoc in the area, severing road connections, washing away bridges, and rendering over half a million people homeless in these mountains – without “dwellings, farmlands, moveable assets,” or even “graveyards.”
It is against this backdrop that the latest contest between India and China must be assessed
But the form of Chinese support for Greece will likely benefit China far more than Greece in the long term
Or have some countries been so scarred by the financial crisis that they don’t care where their next meal ticket comes from?
Indeed, such major carmakers as Toyota, Honda, Daimler, General Motors, and Hyundai/Kia are deep into plans for commercial production of cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells
In its most recent analysis, the US Department of Energy estimated that, using 2010 technology and assuming a production volume of 500,000 units, production costs for an 80-kilowatt fuel cell would be about $57 per kilowatt
That view was embraced by the Obama administration, leading to some embarrassment this summer for new Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist
Nor do I see any evidence at all in favor of the third explanation
Why are we seeing such big price drops?
The Greek Conundrum
The Greek debt crisis brought matters to a climax
For member states, the euro zone is simply too important to fail
Understanding the increased importance of fiscal policy is complicated by confusion over how various euro-zone governments actually make policy decisions – a process that relies on an ever-changing, complex mix of opaque institutional factors and domestic political dynamics that vary considerably from one country to another
“Bolivia is rich,” a Tacana Indian woman told me last week inside Madidi National Park
Economists argue that should the current trickle of 350,000 visitors each year grow to a quite reasonable million, every Bolivian would be employed
The Green Inquisition
A much sounder approach than Kyoto and its successor would be to invest more in research and development of zero-carbon energy technologies – a cheaper, more effective way to truly solve the climate problem
This matters, because in little more than a year, the world will sit down in Copenhagen to negotiate the follow-on treaty to the failed Kyoto Protocol
Many green pundits have, however, started saying that the financial crisis only makes the need for action on climate change greater
He approved oil exploration in closed nature reserves, and also systematically fought to suppress scientific evidence on climate change
All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity (and still be more profitable) and consumers to reduce their use (and gain savings without sacrificing comfort)
Fortunately, we can learn from other cities such as Stockholm, Singapore, and London, which have successfully implemented them
The Bali conference last year agreed to include avoided deforestation in tropical countries into a new climate regime, which could generate new employment opportunities in sustainable management, conservation, and tourism
So, although dollar bonds and, increasingly, dollar equities are a large part of these countries’ sovereign wealth accounts, most of the dollar securities that they hold are not needed to finance trade imbalances
Murder, kidnapping, and extortion have reached record heights
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks, although Israel, like the US, has refused to deal with Hamas
It is Yasir Arafat’s ultimate legacy, for he encouraged not only terrorist violence against Israel, but also anarchy and corruption within his own organization
In effect, Hamas has returned the conflict to the 1960’s and 1970’s, when progress toward peace had to await the PLO’s readiness to stop using terrorism and accept Israel’s existence
For Palestinians, this is likely to be Abbas’s last chance
The first question reflects a long-standing and apparently philosophical dispute between Britain - more accurately, the so-called British financial industry, which comprises almost exclusively non-British firms - and the Continent
Chen’s personal wealth grew conspicuously shortly after he assumed office, but no one could produce hard evidence of his corruption back then

Inevitably, in the bright public square, Augustus the Fool, the poet, faces the Clown of Power
Governments are currently gathered in Poznan, Poland, to reach agreement on how to address the major challenges that stem from global warming
Cameron’s government used to claim that its policies would produce a boom by bringing a visit from the Confidence Fairy that would greatly reduce long-term interest rates and cause a huge surge of private investment spending
Worse, the government might be unable to refinance its debt at all, and then would have to cut spending and raise taxes sharply
In the US, this right-wing resurgence, whose adherents evidently seek to repeal the basic laws of math and economics, is threatening to force a default on the national debt
The Illusion of a Chinese Bubble
In January 2010, despite strict “administrative control” of financial credit lines (the PBC actually imposed credit ceilings on commercial banks), bank lending grew at an annual rate of 29%, on top of already strong expansion in the same period a year earlier
Moreover, roughly 40% of the increase in bank credit in 2009 accommodated the fiscal expansion, as projects were started prior to the budget allocations needed to finance them
Once again, it signifies nothing about policies or their underlying philosophy
Opinion polls show that, above all, what Americans want are jobs – the beginning of inclusion
That is the IMF
Restoring financial market confidence has had to rely on liquidity injections by major central banks
The IMF should also be more proactive and speak with greater candor in systemically important countries, where shortcomings in financial supervision and crisis management have appeared
Meanwhile, East Asia, where governments eschewed these doctrines and were active in promoting growth has seen incomes soar and poverty plummet - despite the crisis of 1997
It is six years since the IMF's fateful meeting in Hong Kong, just before the global financial crisis
While wrong about what to do in the crisis, on this point they were right
It is putting forward economically and politically impossible recommendations, telling Argentina to cut public services to the extreme, when schools and hospitals are already on the verge of collapse
He and his wife had started ripping out all the walls, plumbing, and wiring in their modest Washington apartment, hoping to refurbish it prior to the arrival of their first child
But my loan did help, eventually Hal's business recovered, my nephew was born and--much later--the apartment remodeling project came to a successful conclusion
With our members’ support, we are implementing important reforms to our lending policies that will encourage countries to approach the IMF early on, before crises become severe and almost intractable
Thus, the IMF’s recommendation to use capital controls only after exhausting interest-rate adjustment, reserve accumulation, and prudential regulation is out of step with the profession
Data published in The Lancet last year show that the top ten most burdensome global diseases are more common in men than women, and often by a large margin
After all, an approach that focuses on the half of the population that takes fewer risks and uses health-care services more frequently cannot be expected to eliminate gender inequalities
But some of the most obvious factors shortening men’s lives are to be found in a more pedestrian, yet politically sensitive, area: the differences in the “appropriate” behaviors for men and women, as dictated by society and reinforced by the market
On the surface, the most unusual feature of the ongoing financial crisis is that developed economies have been affected much more strongly and directly than developing economies, many of which have learned from previous crises, put their fiscal houses in order, made progress on structural reforms, and improved supervision and regulation
But India is now bound by the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS agreement, and has revised its patent laws accordingly, causing widespread anxiety in the developing world about the implications for global provision of affordable medicines
NEW YORK – The G-20 has concluded its meetings and dinner discussions of what to do about charges that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has used poison gas to kill more than 1,400 of his own people
But finger-pointing misses the point: Syria’s situation is the strongest evidence yet of a new “G-Zero” world order, in which no single power or bloc of powers will accept the costs and risks that accompany global leadership
While bombing would give Assad plenty to think about, it would not force his surrender or encourage his allies to turn against him
The yield on ten-year Treasuries is now 1.6%, down from 3.4% at the start of 2011
The Fed is unlikely to be able to reduce long-term rates any further
The level of real residential investment is still less than half its level before the recession began

The coalition partners party institutions may exert massive influence over planned reforms, even to the point of stopping them
India already is being treated with growing respect in global economic councils
The second point of convergence between Indian and Western interests is one that will probably get no public mention during Chirac’s visit: India can perhaps serve as a counterweight to China
In the US, the “non-proliferation ayatollahs,” who hypocritically consider nuclear weapons an unmitigated evil except in their own hands, railed against it
Today, it is the leading critic of Ecuador's "neo-liberal" policies related to globalization
Unfortunately, the UN could not prevent the US and other countries from taking actions that almost surely contravene international law
Macroeconomic policy can try to compensate through deficit spending and very low interest rates
But that raises another difficulty. When asked why they do not invest more, most firms cite insufficient demand
Across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, corporations are bulging with cash as their relentless drive for efficiency continues to yield huge profits
Many countries are seeing vigorous growth in prices for housing, commercial real estate, or both
Indeed, given record-high public-debt levels in many countries, few governments have substantial scope to address inequality through further income redistribution
Instability can express itself anywhere
It is probably bad in the short run, but who knows about the longer term?
When dealing with the EU, member states usually aim for arrangements and regulations that ensure cooperation within agreed-upon frameworks

Of course, the malaise that so many people feel cannot be reduced to one factor
Because a firm’s labor costs are someone else’s labor income and demand, what is individually rational for one firm is destructive in the aggregate
And without better intelligence and backing from the UN Security Council to impose significant, timely, and certain penalties on nuclear violators, the IAEA will have difficulty in fulfilling its security mandate
So pervasive is this tension, in fact, that any chance of even beginning the much-needed reconciliation process must now be pushed far into the future
Together with a synthesis of the main conclusions, they will complete the fifth assessment
The second argument was that replacing Saddam with a democratic regime was a way to transform Middle East politics
Bush lacks comparable successes to compensate for his mismanagement of Iraq
Widespread political violence in both Iran and Latin America in the 1960’s and 1970’s demonstrated a connection between popular feelings of powerlessness and the growth of urban guerilla movements
By its immobilization, however, such a community may simply be too passive to oppose the violent men acting in its name
It was because Shi’ite religious leadership felt empowered, optimistic, and secure enough to press the Sadrists to end their revolt
The Irish Think Again About the Lisbon Treaty
Britain fired the first shot in the 1930’s currency war, leaving the gold standard in September 1931
This theory held that prices depend on the supply of money relative to the quantity of goods and services being sold

A second reason is that IT investment in Europe is a more recent phenomenon than in the US
On the one hand, the fact that an international tribunal has pronounced on the responsibility of a state in the matter of genocide is an undeniably positive development
Obesity is on the increase in Mexico
The third hurdle is the danger that the Extraordinary Chambers will be regarded as the end rather than the beginning of a long-term search for accountability and legal reform
Unfortunately, these revelations come at the worst possible moment
Just as giving to someone in need elicits a positive neural response, so does taking from someone who deserves it
So what diplomatic or financial gain was Karzai seeking?
Indeed, King Abdullah sent only a junior prince to accompany Karzai in Mecca, a studied diplomatic affront

Will Lula survive the flood of charges and revelations plaguing his government today?
It also requires a lot of data processing to make the records usable
Cheney was better known as a ruthless bureaucratic operator than a man of bold ideas
Some recent sales of prospecting rights in Africa have been spectacularly deficient in terms of transparency and competition
Reporters may face criminal prosecution for publishing inaccurate information; apparently, this is the basis for the reference to "access to information."
Many in the audience were shocked by his remarks, but Cheney seemingly failed to grasp how appalled his audience was
Closely allied with Syria is Hezbollah, which presides over a virtually autonomous mini-state in south Lebanon
Indeed, the Egyptian and Saudi attitude contrasts starkly with that of two Western powers with extensive influence in Lebanon, the United States and France, which support the UN inquiry wherever it might go
A US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to what happens in Lebanon
Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings, and the country could once again become an arena for destructive regional conflicts, regardless of what the Lebanese prefer
Having money available in advance, on standby for the inevitable, would be sound global policy

But imagine a world where textbooks are continually updated and corrected by a legion of contributors
Everyone has something to teach
To be sure, Microsoft does provide a patch that allows old versions of Office to read the new “.docx” format
More subtly, Microsoft can control expectations, which turn out to be self-fulfilling when network economies are substantial, as they are in software markets
